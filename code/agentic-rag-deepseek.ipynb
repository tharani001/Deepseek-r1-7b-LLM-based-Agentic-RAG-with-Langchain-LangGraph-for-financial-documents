Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.  \\nWe review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for Q3 2024, based on servers that were included in 'Property and equipment, net' as of June 30, 2024 and those acquired during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $760 million and a benefit to net income of $598 million, or $0.06 per basic share and $0.06 per diluted share.

These valuations require significant judgment.  \\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The complaint alleged, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, each entitled 'Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol'; and 7,233,978, entitled 'Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.' The complaint sought an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In April 2024, a jury found that Amazon infringed the asserted patents and awarded Kove $525 million in damages. In August 2024, the court awarded Kove $148 million in pre-judgment interest. In September 2024, we filed a notice of appeal. We disagree with the jury's findings and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.  \\nBeginning in March 2020 with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington ('W.D. Wash.'), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon's stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon's stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another ecommerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in September 2023 in the W.D. Wash. alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace services, and unlawfully maintains those monopolies through anticompetitive practices relating to our pricing policies, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks injunctive and structural relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and costs. In May 2024, the Attorney General of Arizona filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County alleging that Amazon's practices related to pricing and the Featured Offers in its stores violate state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint also seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, civil penalties, and costs. Amazon's motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-Wilson in March 2022 and March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General's lawsuit in March 2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon's pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon's pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In August 2024, the DC Court of Appeals overturned a prior decision by the DC Superior Court dismissing the DC Attorney General's lawsuit and that case is now proceeding. In September 2024, the United States District Court for the W.D. Wash. granted in part Amazon's motion to dismiss the suit brought by the FTC and certain state Attorneys General with respect to five state law claims and denied the motion with respect to the remaining claims. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.  \\nIn October 2020, Broadband iTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and 10,536,751, each entitled 'Video-On-Demand Content Delivery System for Providing Video-On-Demand Services to TV Services Subscribers'; 10,028,026, entitled 'System for Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content on TV Services Platform\"),\n",

The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages. In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $166 million to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the district court granted summary judgment, holding that the patents are invalid. In October 2022, Broadband iTV filed a notice of appeal. In September 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment. This decision is subject to appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.  \\nIn May 2023, Dialect, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District for Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon's Alexa-enabled products and services, such as Echo devices, Fire tablets, Fire TV sticks, Fire TVs, Alexa, and Alexa Voice Services, infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,693,720 and 9,031,845, each entitled 'Mobile Systems and Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance'; 8,015,006, entitled 'Systems and Methods for Processing Natural Language Speech Utterances with Context-Specific Domain Agents'; 8,140,327, entitled 'System and Method for Filtering and Eliminating Noise from Natural Language Utterances to Improve Speech Recognition and Parsing'; 8,195,468 and 9,495,957, each entitled 'Mobile Systems and Methods of Supporting Natural Language Human-Machine Interactions'; and 9,263,039, entitled 'Systems and Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance.' The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In November 2023, the court granted in part Amazon's motion to dismiss Dialect's complaint and dismissed the '845 patent from the case. In July and August 2024, the court granted in part Amazon's motions for summary judgment, holding that Amazon does not infringe the '327 patent or two claims of the '006 patent and that Dialect cannot recover certain alleged damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.  \\nBeginning in October 2023, Nokia Technologies Oy and related entities filed complaints alleging infringement of patents related to video-related technologies against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities in multiple courts in the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil, the Unified Patent Court of the European Union, and the United States International Trade Commission. The complaints allege, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video services and features of Amazon devices carrying the Prime Video app infringe Nokia's patents; some of the complaints additionally allege infringement by Freevee, Twitch, and Amazon voice assistants. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and, in some cases, unspecified money damages, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, and declaratory relief. These matters are at various procedural stages, with preliminary and final injunctions issued in certain instances. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.  \\nIn addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.  \\nThe outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  \\nSee also 'Note 7 - Income Taxes.'  \\n## Table of Contents\"),\n",

Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.  \\nOur quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.  \\nFor 2024, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the U.S. federal research and development credit and foreign income deduction and adversely affected by state income taxes. In addition, valuation gains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and may cause variability in our effective tax rate.  \\nOur income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $4.1 billion, which included $175 million of net discrete tax expense, primarily consisting of discrete tax expense related to shortfalls from stock-based compensation and approximately $600 million of tax benefit resulting from a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our'),\n",

Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings.  \\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods.  \\nWe are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income.  \\nIn September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority ('LTA') denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this matter. We believe the LTA's position is without merit, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect to recoup taxes paid.  \\nThe Indian tax authority ('ITA') has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will need to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate.

The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in 'Technology and infrastructure' are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. Our chief operating decision maker ('CODM') regularly reviews consolidated net sales, consolidated operating expenses, and consolidated operating income (loss) by segment. Amounts included in consolidated operating expenses include 'Cost of sales,' 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and infrastructure,' 'Sales and marketing,' 'General and administrative,' and 'Other operating expense (income), net.' Our CODM manages our business by reviewing annual forecasts and consolidated results by segment on a quarterly basis.\"),\n",

Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks.

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 1 - Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,' of this Form 10-Q.

This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $380 million.  \\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products.

Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.'),\n",

Amounts held in foreign currencies were $23.5 billion and $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen.  \\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $21.2 billion and $26.0 billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $42.5 billion and $70.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  \\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(11.8) billion and $(16.9) billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $(37.2) billion and $(56.9) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $11.3 billion and $21.3 billion during Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $34.8 billion and $51.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect cash capital expenditures to meaningfully increase in 2024, primarily driven by investments in technology infrastructure. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $1.6 billion and $622 million during Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $5.5 billion and $4.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.

(One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In Q3 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a convertible note from Anthropic. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note.  \\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(8.9) billion and $(2.8) billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $(9.1) billion and $(8.5) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of $216 million and $1.7 billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $17.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $9.2 billion and $4.5 billion in Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $26.5 billion and $11.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $183 million and $186 million during Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $431 million and $409 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.  \\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs as of September 30, 2024. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional information.  \\nCertain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.  \\nOur U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $7.0 billion and $8.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.  \\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $503 million and $3.6 billion. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies' and 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.  \\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.  \\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.  \\n## Table of Contents\"),\n",

Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.  \\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in Q3 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact technology and infrastructure costs for Q3 2024, but reduced technology and infrastructure costs by $166 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We currently expense the majority of the costs associated with the development of our satellite network for global broadband service (including production, launch, and payroll costs, and launch services deposits upon launch). We will capitalize certain of these costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers.

Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.  \\nThe People's Republic of China ('PRC') and India regulate Amazon's and its affiliates' businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.  \\nIn addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising revenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade  \\n## Table of Contents  \\nrestrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors negatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.\"),\n",

For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.  \\nAs a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.'),\n",

An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we operate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.  \\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.  \\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.  \\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals.'),\n",

(the 'Company'), Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement (the '2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement'). The 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement replaces the prior $5.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement entered into by the Company, Citibank, N.A., and other lenders on November 1, 2023, which was terminated on October 30, 2024. The 2024 ShortTerm Credit Agreement provides the Company with an unsecured revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $5.0 billion. The term of the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement is 364 days, but it may be extended for an additional period of 364 days subject to approval by the lenders.  \\nThe interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility.  \\nBorrowings under the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes, including backstopping any notes that the Company may issue under its commercial paper program.  \\nThe 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default, but does not contain financial covenants. Upon an event of default that is not cured within the applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the commitments may be terminated.  \\nThe financial institutions party to the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage, and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of these financial institutions and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the Company and to persons and entities with relationships with the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.  \\nThe foregoing description of the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms of such agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.\"),\n",

For purposes of clause (c) above, the Term SOFR on any day shall be based on the Term SOFR Reference Rate at approximately 5:00 a.m., Chicago time, on such day (or any amended publication time for the Term SOFR Reference Rate, as specified by the CME Term SOFR Administrator in the Term SOFR Reference Rate methodology); provided that if such rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero. Any change in the Base Rate due to a change in the NYFRB Rate, the Prime Rate or the Term SOFR shall be effective from and including the effective date of such change in the NYFRB Rate, the Prime Rate or the Term SOFR, as the case may be. If the Base Rate is being used as an alternate rate of interest pursuant to Section 3.03 (for the avoidance of doubt, only until the Benchmark Replacement has been determined pursuant to Section 3.03(b)), then for purposes of clause (c) above the Term SOFR shall be deemed to be zero.  \\n'Base Rate Borrowing' means any Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Loans.  \\n- 'Base Rate Loan' means a Loan that bears interest at a rate based on the Base Rate.  \\n'Benchmark' means, initially, the Term SOFR;

and\\n- (2)        the  sum  of:  (a)  the  alternate  benchmark  rate  that  has  been  selected  by  the Administrative Agent  and  the  Borrower  as  the replacement  for  the  then-current  Benchmark  for  the  applicable  Corresponding  Tenor  giving  due  consideration  to  (i)  any  selection  or recommendation of a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body and/or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement for the then-current Benchmark for syndicated  credit  facilities  denominated  in  US  Dollars  at  such  time  in  the  United  States  and  (b)  the  related  Benchmark  Replacement Adjustment.  \\nIf the Benchmark Replacement as determined pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above would be less than the Floor, the Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  \\n'Benchmark Replacement Adjustment' means, with respect to any replacement of a then-current Benchmark with an Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement  for  any  applicable  Interest  Period  and  Available  Tenor  for  any  setting  of  such  Unadjusted  Benchmark  Replacement,  the  spread adjustment or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment (which may be a positive or negative value or zero)  \\nthat has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (a) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body on the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date and/or (b) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such  spread  adjustment,  for  the  replacement  of  such  Benchmark  with  the  applicable  Unadjusted  Benchmark  Replacement  for  syndicated  credit facilities denominated in US Dollars at such time in the United States.  \\n'Benchmark  Replacement  Conforming  Changes'  means,  with  respect  to  any  Benchmark  Replacement,  any  technical,  administrative  or operational changes (including changes to the definition of 'Base Rate', the definition of 'Business Day', the definition of 'Interest Period', the definition of 'U.S. Government Securities Business Day', timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest, timing of borrowing requests or prepayment, conversion or continuation notices, length of lookback periods, the applicability of breakage provisions, and other technical, administrative or operational matters) that the Administrative Agent determines in its reasonable discretion may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of the applicable Benchmark and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market practice (or, if the Administrative Agent determines in its reasonable discretion that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines that no market practice for the administration of the Benchmark  Replacement  exists,  in  such  other  manner  of  administration  as  the  Administrative  Agent  determines  in  its  reasonable  discretion  is reasonably necessary in connection with the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents).  \\n'Benchmark Replacement Date' means, with respect to any Benchmark, the earliest to occur of the following events with respect to such then-current Benchmark:  \\n- (1)        in  the  case  of  clause  (1)  or  (2)  of  the  definition  of  'Benchmark  Transition  Event',  the  later  of  (a)  the  date  of  the  public statement or publication of information referenced therein and (b) the date on which the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or\\n- (2)    in the case of clause (3) of the definition of 'Benchmark Transition Event', the first date on which such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been or, if such Benchmark is a term rate, all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) have been determined and announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) to be no longer representative; provided that such non-representativeness will be determined by reference to the most recent  statement  or  publication  referenced  in  such  clause  (3)  and  even  if  such  Benchmark  (or  such  component  thereof)  or,  if  such Benchmark is a term rate, any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date.  \\nFor the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the event giving rise to the Benchmark Replacement Date occurs on the same day as, but earlier than, the Reference Time in respect of any determination, the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Reference Time for such determination and (ii) the 'Benchmark Replacement Date' will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with respect to any Benchmark  upon  the  occurrence  of  the  applicable  event  or  events  set  forth  therein  with  respect  to  all  then-current  Available  Tenors  of  such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof).  \\n'Benchmark Transition Event' means, with respect to any Benchmark, the occurrence of one or more of the following events with respect to such then-current Benchmark:  \\n- (1)    a public statement or publication of information by or on behalf of the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof), permanently or indefinitely; provided that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide such Benchmark (or such component thereof) or, if such Benchmark is a term rate, any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof);\\n- (2)    a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published  component  used  in  the  calculation  thereof),  the  Federal  Reserve  Board,  the  NYFRB,  the  CME  Term  SOFR Administrator,  an insolvency  official  with  jurisdiction  over  the  administrator  for  such  Benchmark  (or  such  component  thereof),  a  resolution  authority  with jurisdiction  over  the  administrator  for  such  Benchmark  (or  such  component  thereof)  or  a  court  or  an  entity  with  similar  insolvency  or resolution authority over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component thereof), in each case, which states that the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) has ceased or will cease to provide such Benchmark (or such component thereof) or, if such Benchmark is a term rate, all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) permanently or indefinitely;

Each Loan Notice must be received  by  the Administrative Agent  not  later  than  1:00  p.m.,  New York  City  time,  (i)  three  Business  Days  prior  to  the  requested  date  of  any borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans or of any conversion of Term SOFR Loans denominated to Base Rate Loans, (ii) if applicable pursuant to Section 3.03, one Business Day prior to the requested date of any borrowing of or conversion to Daily Simple SOFR Loans and (iii) on the requested date of any borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be in  an  aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. Each borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans or, if applicable pursuant to Section 3.03, Daily Simple SOFR Loans shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. Each Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a borrowing of Loans, a conversion of Loans from one Type to another or a continuation of Term SOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed, continued or to which existing Loans are to be converted and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. In the case of any conversion or continuation of any Loans, such conversion or continuation shall apply to Loans comprising the same existing Borrowing, it being understood that the Borrower may elect different conversion or continuation options with respect to different portions of the affected existing Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding  the  Loans  comprising  such  Borrowing,  and  the  Loans  comprising  each  such  portion  shall  be  considered  a  separate  Borrowing.  If  the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation of any Term SOFR Borrowing, then, subject to Section 3.03, the applicable Loans shall be made as, or continued as, Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one month. Any such automatic continuation as Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one month shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term SOFR Borrowing. If the Borrower requests a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency.  \\n(b) Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the details thereof and, in the case of a Loan Notice requesting a borrowing of Loans, of the  \\nprincipal amount of its Loans to be made as part of the requested borrowing, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation of any Term SOFR Borrowing is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic continuation as Term SOFR Loans as described in the preceding subsection.

The Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case, in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.  \\n- (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, upon the request of the Required Lenders no Loans shall be converted to or continued as Term SOFR Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.\\n- (d) The Administrative Agent shall, promptly upon request, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Term SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate.\\n- (e) After giving effect to all borrowings of Loans, all conversions of Loans from one Type to another, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Term SOFR Borrowings and Daily Simple SOFR Borrowings outstanding at any given time.\"),\n",

Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and, if a Term SOFR Borrowing is to be prepaid, the Interest Period applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such prepayment.

Any prepayment of a Term SOFR Loan or Daily Simple SOFR Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid. Subject to Section 2.13, each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders comprising such Borrowing in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.  \\n- (b) If  the  Administrative  Agent  notifies  the  Borrower  at  any  time  that  the  Total  Outstandings  at  such  time  exceed  the  Aggregate Commitments then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall prepay Loans in an aggregate amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.\\n- 2.04 Termination or Reduction of Commitments . The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction (or such shorter period  as  may  be  agreed  by  the  Administrative  Agent  in  its  sole  discretion),  (ii)  any  such  partial  reduction  shall  be  (unless  the  Aggregate Commitments are less than such amount) a whole multiple of US$1,000,000 and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments  if,  after  giving  effect  thereto  and  to  any  concurrent  prepayments  hereunder,  the  Total  Outstandings  would  exceed  the Aggregate Commitments. A notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitment may state that such termination or reduction is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such termination or reduction) if any applicable condition is not satisfied. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage. Unless previously terminated, the Aggregate Commitments shall automatically terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Maturity Date. Any reduction or termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall  be  permanent. All unpaid fees accrued pursuant to Section 2.07(a) until the effective date of any reduction or termination of the Aggregate Commitments (in the case of any reduction, in respect of the aggregate amount of the Commitments subject to such reduction) shall be paid on the effective date of such reduction or termination.  \\n2.05 Repayment of Loans.

The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and the commitment fee accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, shall be due and payable in arrears on the 15th day following such last day (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the immediately preceding Business Day) and accrued but unpaid commitment fees shall also be due and payable on the last day of the Availability Period.\\n- (b) Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account, in US Dollars, fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.\\n- 2.08 Computation of Interest and Fees.

Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which such Loan is made, and shall not accrue on any Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which such Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.\\n- 2.09 Evidence of Debt. The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to the Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans to the Borrower in addition to such accounts or records.

All  payments  to  be  made  by  the  Borrower  shall  be  made  free  and  clear  of  and  without  condition  or  deduction  for  any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, it being understood that nothing in this Section 2.10 shall affect the rights of the Borrower to withhold for Taxes as provided in Section 3.01. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Account in US Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 4:00 p.m., New York City time, shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue until such day. Except as expressly provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.\\n- (b) (i)    Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any borrowing of Loans that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of the applicable Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of  a  payment  to  be  made  by  such  Lender,  the  NYFRB  Rate,  plus  any  administrative,  processing  or  similar  fees  customarily  charged  by  the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the  Loans  comprising  such  Borrowing.  If  the  Borrower  and  such  Lender  shall  pay  such  interest  to  the Administrative Agent  for  the  same  or  an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.\\n- (ii)    Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the NYFRB Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.  \\nA notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  \\n- (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to the Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.\\n- (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) or 11.05 are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) or 11.05 on any  date  required  hereunder  shall  not  relieve  any  other  Lender  of  its  corresponding  obligation  to  do  so  on  such  date,  and  no  Lender  shall  be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c) or 11.05.\\n- (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.\\n- 2.11 Sharing  of  Payments  by  Lenders. If  any  Lender  shall,  by  exercising  any  right  of  setoff  or  counterclaim  or  otherwise,  obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that:\\n- (i) if  any  such  participations  are  purchased  and  all  or  any  portion  of  the  payment  giving  rise  thereto  is  recovered,  such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and\\n- (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as amended from time to time) (including Sections 2.13 and 3.02) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply).  \\nThe Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation  pursuant  to  the  foregoing  arrangements  may  exercise  against  the  Borrower  rights  of  setoff  and  counterclaim  with  respect  to  such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.\"),\n",

Each Lender shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the date that is 20 days after the date of the Borrower's notice requesting an extension of the Maturity Date (the 'Response Date'), advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension; provided that any Lender that does not advise the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Response Date shall be deemed to be have declined to agree to such extension (each Lender agreeing to the requested extension being called an 'Extending Lender', and each Lender declining or deemed to have declined to agree to the requested extension being called a 'Non-Extending Lender'). The election of any Lender to agree or to decline to agree to any requested extension shall be in its sole and individual discretion, and the agreement of any Lender shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.\\n- (c) Notification by Administrative Agent.

If  Lenders  constituting  not  less  than  the  Required  Lenders  shall  have  agreed,  prior  to  the Existing Maturity Date, to extend the Maturity Date, then, effective as of the Existing Maturity Date, the Maturity Date applicable to the Extending Lenders shall be the date 364 days after the Existing Maturity Date; provided that no extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall become effective unless (the first date on which such consent of the Required Lenders is obtained and the conditions specified in this proviso are satisfied with respect to the applicable requested extension being called the 'Extension Closing Date' with respect thereto), the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate (together with resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or otherwise consenting to such extension) on or prior to the Extension Closing Date signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying that, before and after giving effect to such extension (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality, in which case they shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Extension Closing Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality, in which case they shall be true and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.12, the representations and warranties contained in subsection (a) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements delivered (or otherwise made available) pursuant to  subsection  (a)  of  Section  6.01  (and,  if  any  financial  statements  shall  have  been  subsequently  delivered  pursuant  to  subsection  (b)  of Section 6.01, then also to such financial statements so subsequently delivered), and (B) no Default exists.

Solely for purposes of this clause (D), 'FATCA' shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.\\n- (iii)    Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  \\n- (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will any Recipient be required to pay any amount to the  Borrower  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  the  payment  of  which  would  place  such  Recipient  in  a  less  favorable  net  after-Tax  position  than  such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed  and  the  indemnification  payments  or  additional  amounts  with  respect  to  such  Tax  had  never  been  paid.  This  subsection  shall  not  be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.\\n- (g) Contesting Indemnified Taxes. If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Indemnified Taxes for which additional amounts have been paid or are due under this Section 3.01, the Administrative Agent or Lender (as applicable) shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such Indemnified Taxes, at the Borrower's expense, if so requested by the Borrower in  writing;  provided  that  nothing  in  this  Section  3.01(g)  shall  obligate  the  Administrative  Agent  or  any  Lender  to  take  any  action  that,  in  its reasonable judgment, would be materially disadvantageous to such Person.\\n- (h) Survival. Each party's obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.\\n- (i) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section, the term 'applicable law' includes FATCA.\\n- 3.02 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to a Relevant Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon a Relevant Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans, as applicable, or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the  interest  rate  on  such  Base  Rate  Loans  of  such  Lender  shall,  if  necessary  to  avoid  such  illegality,  be  determined  by  the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case, until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay all Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans, as applicable, of such Lender or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such  \\nillegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans and in the case of Daily Simple SOFR Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.\"),\n",

To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 11.04 to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought or, if such payment  is  sought  after  the  date  upon  which  the  Commitments  shall  have  terminated,  ratably  in  accordance  with  such  Applicable  Percentage immediately prior to such date) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender), provided further  that  the  unreimbursed  expense  or  indemnified  Liability  or  related  expense,  as  the  case  may  be,  was  incurred  by  or  asserted  against  the Administrative  Agent  (or  any  such  sub-agent)  in  its  capacity  as  such,  or  against  any  Related  Party  of  any  of  the  foregoing  acting  for  the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity.

In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon)  and  (y)  acquire  (and  fund  as  appropriate)  its  full  pro  rata  share  of  all  Loans  in  accordance  with  its  Applicable  Percentage.

Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 11.06.  \\n- (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal  \\namounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 'Register'). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  \\n- (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations  to  any  Person  (other  than  a  natural  person  (or  a  holding  company,  investment  vehicle  or  trust  for,  or  owned  and  operated  for  the primary benefit of a natural person), a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) (each, a 'Participant') in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 11.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.  \\nAny agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.01 that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 11.06 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 11.13 as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section 11.06 and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from which it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive. Each Lender that sells  a  participation  agrees,  at  the  Borrower's  request  and  expense,  to  use  reasonable  efforts  to  cooperate  with  the  Borrower  to  effectuate  the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting as a non-fiduciary agent, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the 'Participant Register'); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or  any  portion  of  the  Participant  Register  (including  the  identity  of  any  Participant  or  any  information  relating  to  a  Participant's  interest  in  any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to  the  contrary.  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  the Administrative Agent  (in  its  capacity  as Administrative Agent)  shall  have  no  responsibility  for maintaining a Participant Register.  \\n- (e) Certain  Pledges. Any  Lender  may  at  any  time  pledge  or  assign  a  security  interest  in  all  or  any  portion  of  its  rights  under  this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;  \\nprovided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  \\n11.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality . Subject to the last sentence of this Section 11.07, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to those of its Affiliates and its and their Related Parties that the Administrative Agent or any such Lender reasonably determines needs to know such Information (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.07), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority that has or claims to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or  proceeding  relating  to  this  Agreement  or  any  other  Loan  Document  or  the  enforcement  of  rights  hereunder  or  thereunder,  (f)  subject  to  an agreement containing provisions substantively the same as (or more restrictive than) those of this Section 11.07, to any assignee of or any prospective assignee  of,  any  of  its  rights  and  obligations  under  this Agreement,  (g)  with  the  consent  of  the  Borrower  or  (h)  to  the  extent  such  Information becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.07. For purposes of this Section 11.07, 'Information' means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (x) nothing contained in this Section 11.07 shall supersede, as to any Information  provided  pursuant  thereto,  any  nondisclosure  or  confidentiality  provision  contained  in  any  nondisclosure  agreement,  confidentiality agreement or other similar agreement (any such agreement, a 'Nondisclosure Agreement') entered into between the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Lender or any of its Affiliates, on the other, to the extent otherwise applicable to any Information; it being understood and agreed that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 11.07 and the nondisclosure or confidentiality provisions contained in any Nondisclosure Agreement as it relates to any such Information, the nondisclosure or confidentiality provision contained in such Nondisclosure Agreement shall govern; and (y) whether or not any Loan Document constitutes Information, the Loan Documents (other than the Fee Letter) can be shared on a confidential basis with (i) any Participant or prospective Participant hereunder, (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (iii) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facility provided hereunder, (iv) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facility provided hereunder or (v) in the case of this Agreement, any market data collector or service provider.  \\n11.08 Right  of  Setoff. If  an  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and  be  continuing,  each  Lender  and  each  of  its Affiliates  is  hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency, but excluding deposits in (i) trust or other fiduciary accounts (to the extent of amounts held therein in trust in the ordinary course of business on behalf of third parties that are not the Borrower or its Subsidiaries), (ii) payroll accounts, (iii) health-savings accounts and worker's compensation accounts, (iv) withholding tax accounts and (v) zero balance accounts used in the ordinary course of business) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not  \\nsuch obligations of the Borrower are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit  or  obligated  on  such  indebtedness;  provided  that  in  the  event  that  any  Defaulting  Lender  shall  exercise  any  such  right  of  setoff,  (x)  all amounts  so  set  off  shall  be  paid  over  immediately  to  the  Administrative  Agent  for  further  application  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Section 2.13 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of  the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Lenders,  and  (y)  the  Defaulting  Lender  shall  provide  promptly  to  the  Administrative  Agent  a  statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section 11.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or Affiliates  may  have.  Each  Lender  agrees  to  notify  the  Borrower  and  the  Administrative Agent  promptly  after  any  such  setoff  and  application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  \\n11.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the 'Maximum Rate'). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the  principal  of  the  Loans  or,  if  it  exceeds  such  unpaid  principal,  refunded  to  the  Borrower.  In  determining  whether  the  interest  contracted  for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.  \\n11.10 Counterparts; Entire Agreement; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in  different  counterparts),  each  of  which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire  contract  among  the  parties  relating  to  the  subject  matter  hereof  (OTHER  THAN  ANY  NONDISCLOSURE  OR  CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS  CONTAINED  IN ANY  NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT  TO  THE  EXTENT APPLICABLE  TO  THE  INFORMATION  (AS DEFINED HEREIN)) and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof (but do not  supersede  any  provisions  of  any  engagement  letter  or  any  fee  letter  that  by  the  terms  of  such  documents  survive  the  effectiveness  of  this Agreement, all of which provisions shall remain in full force and effect). There are no unwritten oral agreements among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including without limitation, Assignment and Assumptions, amendments or other modifications, Loan Notices, waivers and consents) (each, an 'Ancillary Document') that is an Electronic Signature transmitted by emailed .pdf or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.  \\n11.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties . All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such  \\nrepresentations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.  \\n- 11.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.

       " Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'Family Metrics', 'company': 'facebook'}, page_content='## Family Metrics  \\nThe numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We report our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP) and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement.  \\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.  \\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as data limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base that have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.  \\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further below, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data', 'company': 'facebook'}, page_content='## Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data  \\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have  in  the  past  contributed,  and  may  in  the  future  contribute,  to  changes  in  our  reported  Family  metrics  from  period  to  period.  In  addition,  our  data  limitations  may  affect  our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys,  algorithms,  or  machine  learning  that  may  improve  our  ability  to  match  accounts  within  and  across  our  products  or  otherwise  evaluate  the  broad  population  of  our  users.  In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).  \\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the first quarter of 2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look  for  account  information  and  behaviors  associated  with  Facebook  and  Instagram  accounts  that  appear  to  be  inauthentic  to  the  reviewers,  but  we  have  limited  visibility  into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.'),\n",

These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location.

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.  \\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.  \\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40  billion.  We  continue  to  expect  significant  capital  expenditures  growth  in  2025.  Given  this,  along  with  the  back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.  \\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.  \\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.'),\n",

These  forwardlooking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to  retain  or  increase  users  and  engagement  levels;  our  reliance  on  advertising  revenue;  our  dependency  on  data  signals  and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth  and  engagement  and  the  user  experience  over  short-term  financial  results;  maintaining  and  enhancing  our  brand  and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries;  litigation  and  government  inquiries;  privacy,  legislative,  and  regulatory  concerns  or  developments;  risks  associated with  acquisitions;  security  breaches;  our  ability  to  manage  our  scale  and  geographically-dispersed  operations;  and  market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends.

       " Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures', 'company': 'facebook'}, page_content='## Non-GAAP Financial Measures  \\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  United  States  (GAAP),  we  use  the  following  non-GAAP  financial  measures:  revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use  of  non-GAAP  financial  measures  as  an  analytical  tool.  In  addition,  these  measures  may  be  different  from  non-GAAP financial  measures  used  by  other  companies,  limiting  their  usefulness  for  comparison  purposes.  We  compensate  for  these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.  \\nWe believe  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplemental  information  about  the  financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.  \\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:  \\nForeign exchange effect on revenue . We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 using the prior  year\\'s  monthly  exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.  \\nPurchases  of  property  and  equipment;  Principal  payments  on  finance  leases. We  subtract  both  purchases  of  property  and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these  two  items  collectively  represent  the  amount  of  property  and  equipment  we  need  to  procure  to  support  our  business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful  supplemental  information  to  help  investors  better  understand  underlying  trends  in  our  business.  Free  cash  flow  is  not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.  \\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.'),\n",

Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platforms third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Susan Li, CFO.  \\nBefore we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements.  \\nFactors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's earnings press release, and in our quarterly report on form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  \\nDuring this call we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.  \\nAnd now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'Mark Zuckerberg, CEO', 'company': 'facebook'}, page_content=\"## Mark Zuckerberg, CEO  \\nThanks, Ken. This was a good quarter with strong product and business momentum, and with parts of our long-term vision around AI and the future of computing coming into sharper focus. We estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day -- and we're seeing rapid adoption of Meta AI and Llama, which is quickly becoming a standard across the industry.  \\nSo let's start with some highlights from the apps. For WhatsApp, the US remains one of our fastest growing countries. And we just passed a milestone of 2 billion calls made globally every day. On Facebook, we continue to see positive trends with young adults, especially in the US. On Instagram, global growth remains strong. We also launched Teen Accounts this quarter, which add built-in protections that limit who teens are messaging and what content they can see. On Threads, the community now has almost 275 million monthly actives. It has been growing more than 1 million sign-ups per day. Engagement is growing too. So we continue to be on track towards this becoming our next major social app.  \\nWe are making a lot of progress with our AI efforts too, and we're seeing AI have a positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work -- from our core business engagement and monetization to our long-term roadmaps for new services and computing platforms. And I think that this partially comes from having a vision and roadmap that is aligned with the direction that technology is heading, but even more importantly from our teams doing some really excellent work on execution on so many fronts.  \\nMeta AI now has more than 500 monthly actives. Improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone. More than a million advertisers used our GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in the last month, and we estimate that businesses using Image Generation are seeing a 7% increase in conversions -- and we believe that there is a lot more upside here.  \\nWe're also seeing great momentum with Llama. Llama token usage has grown exponentially this year, and the more widely that Llama gets adopted and becomes the industry standard, the more that the improvements to its quality and efficiency will flow back to all of our products. This quarter, we released Llama 3.2, including the leading small models that run on-device and open source multi-modal models. We're working with enterprises to make it easier to use, and now we're also working with the public sector to adopt Llama across the US government.  \\nThe Llama 3 models have been something of an inflection point in the industry, but I'm even more excited about Llama 4, which is now well into its development. We're training the Llama 4 models on a cluster that is bigger than 100k H100s or bigger than anything that I've seen reported for what others are doing. I expect that the smaller Llama 4 models will be ready first, and they ll be ' ready, we expect sometime early next year, and I think that they're going to be a big deal on several fronts -- new modalities, capabilities, stronger reasoning, and much faster. It seems pretty clear to me that open source will be the most cost-effective, customizable, trustworthy, performant, and easiest-to-use option that is available to developers, and I'm proud that Llama is leading the way on this.  \\nNow it's the time of the year at Meta when we plan our budget for the next year. That's still in progress, but I wanted to share a few things that have stood out to me as we've gone through this process so far. First, it's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there. Second, our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too. We haven't decided on a final budget yet, but those are some of the directional trends I'm seeing.  \\nMoving on, this quarter we also had several milestones around Reality Labs and the integration of AI and wearables.  \\nRay-Ban Meta glasses are the prime example here. They're great-looking glasses that let you take photos and videos, listen to music and take calls. But what makes them really special is the Meta AI integration. With our new updates it'll be able to not only answer your questions throughout the day, but also help you remember things, give you suggestions as you're doing things using realtime multimodal AI, and even translate other languages right in your ear for you. I continue to think that glasses are the ideal form factor for AI because you can let your AI see what you see, hear what you hear, and talk to you.  \\nDemand for the glasses continues to be very strong. The new clear edition that we released at Connect sold out almost immediately and has been trading online for over a thousand dollars. We've deepened our partnership with EssilorLuxottica to build future generations of smart eyewear that deliver both cutting-edge technology and style.  \\nAt Connect we also showed Orion, our first full holographic AR glasses. We've been working on this one for about a decade, and it gives you a sense of where this is all going. We're not too far off from being able to deliver great-looking glasses that let you seamlessly blend the physical and  \\ndigital worlds so you can feel present with anyone no matter where they are. We're starting to see the next computing platform come together, and it's pretty exciting.  \\nWe also released our newest mixed reality headset: Quest 3S. It brings the best capabilities of Quest 3 -- high quality color passthrough, a new chipset, and more -- at the much more accessible price point of $300. Reviews are great so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing how well it does this holiday season as more people get their hands on it.  \\nOverall, this has been a good quarter. I'm pretty amped about all the work that we're doing right now. This may be the most dynamic moment that I've seen in our industry, and I'm focused on making sure that we build some awesome things and make the most of the opportunities ahead. And if we do this well, then the potential for Meta and everyone building with us will be massive. As always, I'm grateful for everyone who is on this journey with us -- our teams, our partners, and our investors.  \\nAnd now here's Susan.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'Susan Li, CFO', 'company': 'facebook'}, page_content=\"## Susan Li, CFO  \\nThanks Mark and good afternoon everyone.  \\nLet's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.  \\nQ3 total revenue was $40.6 billion, up 19% or 20% on a constant currency basis.  \\nQ3 total expenses were $23.2 billion, up 14% compared to last year.  \\nIn terms of the specific line items:  \\nCost of revenue increased 19%, driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs.  \\nR&amp;D increased 21%, mostly driven by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs.  \\nMarketing &amp; Sales decreased 2% driven primarily by lower restructuring costs.  \\nG&amp;A decreased 10% driven primarily by lower legal-related expenses.  \\nWe ended the third quarter with over 72,400 employees, up 9% year-over-year, with growth primarily driven by hiring in our priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, generative AI, as well as regulation and compliance.  \\nThird quarter operating income was $17.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin.  \\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 12%.  \\nNet income was $15.7 billion or $6.03 per share.  \\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.2 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Our capital expenditures were  \\nimpacted in part by the timing of third quarter server deliveries, which will be paid for in the fourth quarter.  \\nFree cash flow was $15.5 billion. In Q3, we completed a debt offering of $10.5 billion, repurchased $8.9 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $70.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt.  \\nMoving now to our segment results.  \\nI'll begin with our Family of Apps segment.  \\nOur community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in September.  \\nQ3 Total Family of Apps revenue was $40.3 billion, up 19% year over year.  \\nQ3 Family of Apps ad revenue was $39.9 billion, up 19% or 20% on a constant currency basis.  \\nWithin ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by healthcare and entertainment and media.  \\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 23% and 21%, respectively. Asia-Pacific grew 18% and North America grew 16%. On an advertiser geography basis, total revenue growth was strongest in North America and Europe at 21%. Rest of World was up 17%, while Asia Pacific was the slowest growing region at 15%, decelerating from our second quarter growth rate of 28% due mainly to lapping a period of stronger demand from China-based advertisers.  \\nIn Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 7% and the average price per ad increased 11%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand, in part due to improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces.  \\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $434 million, up 48%, driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform.  \\nWe continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $18.5 billion, representing approximately 80% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 13%, primarily due to higher infrastructure and headcount-related expenses, partially offset by lower legal-related expenses. Family of Apps operating income was $21.8 billion, representing a 54% operating margin.  \\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was $270 million, up 29% driven by hardware sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.7 billion, up 19% year-over-year driven primarily by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs.  \\nReality Labs operating loss was $4.4 billion.  \\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time.  \\nOn the first, we are focused on both improving people's experiences within our apps today and investing in longer-term initiatives that have the potential to contribute to engagement in the years ahead.  \\nWe expect our content recommendations roadmap will span both of these timeframes, as we have nearer-term workstreams focused on improving recommendations as well as multi-year initiatives to develop innovative new approaches.  \\nI'll focus first on the near -term. In the third quarter, we continued to see daily usage grow yearover-year across Facebook and Instagram, both globally and in the U.S.  \\nOn Facebook, we're seeing strong results from the global rollout of our unified video player in June. Since introducing the new experience and prediction systems that power it, we've seen a 10% increase in time spent within the Facebook video player. This month, we've entered the next phase of Facebook's video product evolution. Starting in the US &amp; Canada, we are updating the standalone video tab to a full screen viewing experience, which will allow people to seamlessly watch videos in a more immersive experience. We expect to complete this global roll out in early 2025.  \\nOn Instagram, Reels continues to see good traction and we're making ongoing progress with our focus on promoting original content, with more than 60% of recommendations now coming from original posts in the U.S. This is helping people find unique and differentiated content on Instagram while also helping earlier stage creators get discovered.  \\nNext, let me talk more about our multi-year roadmap for recommendations. Previously, we operated separate ranking and recommendation systems for each of our products because we found that performance did not scale if we expanded the model size and compute power beyond a certain point. However, inspired by the scaling laws we were observing with large language models, last year we developed new ranking model architectures capable of learning more effectively from significantly larger data sets. To start, we have been deploying these new architectures to our Facebook video ranking models, which has enabled us to deliver more relevant recommendations and unlock meaningful gains in watch time.  \\nNow, we're exploring whether these new models can unlock similar improvements to recommendations on other surfaces. After that, we will look to introduce cross-surface data to these models so our systems can learn from what is interesting to someone on one surface of our apps and use it to improve their recommendations on another. This will take time to execute, and there are other explorations that we will pursue in parallel. However, over time we are optimistic that this will unlock more relevant recommendations while also leading to higher engineering efficiency as we operate a smaller number of recommendation models.  \\nBeyond recommendations, we're making progress with our other longer -term engagement priorities, including Generative AI and Threads.  \\nMeta AI usage continues to scale as we make it available in more countries and languages. We're seeing lifts in usage as we improve our models and have introduced a number of enhancements in  \\nrecent months to make Meta AI more helpful and engaging. Last month, we began introducing Voice, so you can speak with Meta AI more naturally, and it's now fully available in English to people in the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. In the US, people can now also upload photos to Meta AI to learn more about them, write captions for posts, and add, remove, or change things about their images with a simple text prompt. These are all built with our first multi-modal foundation model, Llama 3.2.  \\nThreads remains another area where we see exciting potential. We are bringing on an increasing number of new users each quarter while depth of engagement also continues to grow. Looking ahead, we plan to introduce more features to make it even easier for people to stay up to date on topics they care about.  \\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency. There are two parts to this work.  \\nThe first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement.  \\nWe continue to see opportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces, like video. Within Facebook, video engagement continues to shift to short form following the unification of our video player, and we expect this to continue with the transition of the video tab to a full screen format. This is resulting in organic video impressions growing more quickly than overall video time on Facebook, which provides more opportunities to serve ads.  \\nAcross both Facebook and Instagram, we are also continuing our broader work to optimize when and where we should show ads within a person's session. This is enabling us to drive revenue and conversion growth without increasing the number of ads.  \\nThe second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance.  \\nSimilar to organic content ranking, we are finding opportunities to achieve meaningful ads performance gains by adopting new approaches to modeling. For example, we recently deployed new learning and modeling techniques that enable our ads systems to consider the sequence of actions a person takes before and after seeing an ad. Previously, our ads systems could only aggregate those actions together, without mapping the sequence. This new approach allows our systems to better anticipate how audiences will respond to specific ads. Since we adopted the new models in the first half of this year we've already seen a 2-4% increase in conversions based on testing within selected segments.  \\nWe are also evolving our ads platform to ensure that the results we drive are customized to each business' objectives and to the way they measure value. In Q3, we introduced changes to our ads ranking and optimization models to take more of the cross-publisher journey into account, which we expect to increase the Meta-attributed conversions that advertisers see in their third party analytics tools. We're also testing new features and settings for advertisers that will allow them to optimize their campaigns for what they value most, such as driving incremental conversions rather than absolute conversions.  \\nFinally, there is continued momentum with our Advantage+ solutions, including our ad creative tools. We're seeing strong retention with advertisers using our generative AI -powered image expansion, background generation and text generation tools, and they'r e already driving improved performance for advertisers even at this early stage. Earlier this month we began testing our first  \\nvideo generation features - video expansion and image animation. We expect to make them more broadly available by early next year.  \\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We continue to take a long-term view in running the business, which involves investing in a portfolio of opportunities that we expect will generate returns over different time periods. We are very optimistic about the set of opportunities in front of us, and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will not only accelerate our progress, but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each area. This includes investing in both near-term initiatives to deliver continued healthy revenue growth within our core business, as well as longer-term opportunities that have the scale to deliver compelling returns over time. Given the lead time of our longer-term investments, we also continue to maximize our flexibility so that we can react to market developments. Within Reality Labs, this has benefited us as we've evolved our roadmaps to respond to the earlier -thanexpected success of smart glasses. Within generative AI, we expect significantly scaling up our infrastructure capacity now, while also prioritizing its fungibility, will similarly position us well to respond to how the technology and market develop in the years ahead.  \\nMoving now to our financial outlook.  \\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.  \\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.  \\nTurning now to the capex outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capex, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.  \\nOn to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.  \\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.  \\nIn closing, this was another good quarter for our business. Our global community continues to grow, we're seeing ongoing momentum across our core priorities, and we have exciting opportunities ahead of us to drive further growth in our core business in 2025 and capitalize on the longer-term opportunities ahead.  \\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.  \\nOperator:  \\nBrian Nowak:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nThank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. To ask a question, please press star one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw your question, again press star one. Please limit yourself to one question. Please pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If you are streaming today's call, please mute your computer speakers. And your first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.  \\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Mark and one for Susan. Mark, I wanted to sort of ask you about Meta AI a little bit.  \\nCan you help us understand some of the more recurring types of interactions or query types you're seeing with this product and whether they have commercial intent? And then just over time, how do you think about building your own inhouse search offering as opposed to partnering and having another player partner those queries?  \\nAnd then Susan, I wanted to ask you about sort of head count because you talked a lot about sort of infrastructure investment in '25. How do we sort of think about relative headcount investments into '25 to sort of support all that infrastructure versus w hat you've been doing in 2024? Thanks.  \\nBrian, thanks for the question. This is Susan. So your first question was around what kinds of recurring interactions that we see between people and to their usage of Meta AI. And we're seeing -- first of all, I think, as Mark mentioned, just we're excited about the progress of Meta AI.  \\nIt's obviously very early in its journey, but it continues to be on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by end of year and it has over 500 million monthly actives.  \\nAnd people are using it for many things. A number of the frequent use cases we're seeing include information gathering, help with how to tasks, which is the largest use case. But we also see people using it to go deeper on interests, to look for content o n our services, for image generation, that's also been another pretty popular use case so far. And I would say, that in the near term our focus is really on making Meta AI increasingly valuable for people and if we're successful, we think there will be a broadening set of queries that people use it for, including more monetizable queries over time.  \\nThe second part of your question, Meta AI draws from content across the web to address timely questions from users, and it provides sources for those results from our search engine partners. We've integrated with Bing and Google, both of whom offer great search experiences.  \\nLike other companies, we also train our Gen AI models on content that is publicly available online, and we crawl the web for a variety of purposes. Your second question was really, I think, around maybe how we're thinking about headcount in 2025. And we are still working through our budgeting processes for '25. That's in part why we changed our forward -looking guidance approach to give guidance in the next call.  \\nOperator:  \\nBut as we're working through this, we are looking at where there are opportunities for us to invest in our strategic priorities and that includes monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, Gen AI, our ongoing investments in regulation and compliance.  \\nAnd we're really evaluating each of those opportunities with an eye towards what either the measurable ROI looks like or what the strategic opportunity looks like, depending on what the area is. And we're supporting that by continuing to really focus on streamlining our operations elsewhere.  \\nSo we don't have --we don't have specifics to share about headcount growth in 2025, but that gives you a little bit of the flavor of where we are in the budgeting process.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.  \\nEric Sheridan:  \\nThanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just one building on that question from Brian and going back to Mark's comments about the learnings as you do go through the business planning process. Mark, I wanted to understand better what you continue to learn about what the biggest opportunity sets are to apply AI to when you think about your platform, your product portfolio, and your internal processes because you sound quite optimistic about key learnings and how they continue to ramp and maybe even accelerate in terms of the potential for return profile? I just want to go a little bit deeper into what your key learnings are as you go through that process? Thank you.  \\nMark Zuckerberg:  I think the main point here is just that it seems broadly applicable to a very wide variety of products. So there are areas that are more part of our core business from making Feed more relevant and Reels more relevant to making ads more relevant to helping advertisers generate better ads, to helping people create the content that they want, helping our integrity operations and compliance and the work that we do there, that's important.  \\nIt's very valuable across all these aspects of the core business, but then it also is going to enable completely new types of services, like we didn't have something like Meta AI before.  \\nWe didn't have something like the Ray -Ban Meta glasses before and AI is going to be a really important ingredient of all of these things. There are also other new products like that, things around AI Studio.  \\nThis year, we really focused on rolling out Meta AI as kind of our -- our kind of single assistant that people can ask any question to, but I think there's a lot of opportunities that I think we'll see ramp more over the next year in terms of both consumer and business use cases, for people interacting with a wide variety of different AI agents, consumer ones with AI Studio around whether  \\nit's different creators or kind of different agents that people create for entertainment.  \\nOr on the business side, we do want to continue making progress on this vision of making it so that any small business or any business over time can, with a few clicks, stand up an AI agent that can help do customer service and sell things to all of their customers around the world, and I think that's a huge opportunity.  \\nSo it's very broad. And I think part of what we're seeing is that there are a lot of opportunities. Some of the longer-term ones are on Meta AI or AI Studio; those aren't necessarily a next few years, massive profit opportunity. But there are a lot of things in the core business around engagement and monetization which I think will be, over the next few years.  \\nSo I think we're trying to make sure that we get the right people working on this and that we have the right amount of investment that's just going towards what we view as a very, very large opportunity.  \\nOperator:  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.  \\nDouglas Anmuth:  Great, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a follow-up first on Meta AI, Mark. I mean helpful context certainly to understand how people are using the platform today. Maybe you can just talk more about some of that functionality over time as agents are introduced, just how you really expect use cases to expand beyond just longer and more complex queries?  \\nAnd then, Susan, on CapEx, just trying to understand your comment on 4Q a little bit more. It sounds like some of the payments pushed into 4Q with the guidance suggesting $15 billion to $17 billion in CapEx in the quarter? And is that something we should think about as run rate into 2025? Thank you.  \\nMark Zuckerberg:  \\nYes. I mean I can take the Meta AI question, although I'm sort of intentionally now not saying too much about the new capabilities and modalities that we're launching with Llama 4 that are coming to Meta AI.  \\nI mean I noted in the comments upfront that there -- with each major generational update, I expect that there will be large new capacities that get added.  \\nBut I think that, that's just going to be --that's partially what I'm excited about, and we'll talk more about that next year when we're ready to. One of the trends that I do think we're going to see though is having the models not just power Meta AI or a single assistant, but across AI Studio and business agents, have that grow.  \\nI mean this year, if you look back to where we were about a year ago, we were starting to roll out Meta AI. This year we have really so far succeeded in having  \\nSusan Li:  \\nOperator:  \\nJustin Post:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nthat grow and having a lot of people use that. There's obviously a lot more depth of engagement and new use cases that we want to add over time.  \\nBut I'd say that we're -- today, with AI Studio and business AIs about where we were with Meta AI about a year ago.  \\nSo I think in the next year, our goal around that is going to be to try to make those pretty widespread use cases, even though there's going to be a multiyear path to getting kind of the depth of usage and the business results around that that we want. So there's a lot to do here, though, and I'm excited to talk about that starting earlier next year.  \\nThanks, Doug. So your second question was about Q4 CapEx. The expected step-up in Q4 CapEx from Q3, part of that comes from increases in server spend and to a lesser extent, data center CapEx.  \\nBut with servers there are these timing dynamics at play that you referred to because we had these server deliveries that landed late in Q3. And so the cash doesn't go out the door basically until Q4, and that's when you'll see the CapEx show up.  \\nAnd given the nature of capital expenditures, generally, there is some -actually quite a bit of lumpiness quarter-toquarter. So it's a little bit hard to sort of extrapolate from any particular quarter. Overall, I'd say we're growing our infrastructure investments significantly this year, and we expect significant growth again in 2025.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.  \\nGreat. I think I'll ask a cost question this time. Just thinking about use of AI and employee productivity, how are you able to utilize AI internally? And are you seeing big productivity gains in your R&amp;D group? And second, I know I got to the headcount one more time but, Susan, how flexible is your headcount as you think about cost growth in other areas? Thanks.  \\nJustin, so I'll take a crack at both of those. On the use of AI and employee productivity, it's certainly something that we --that we're very excited about. I don't know that we have anything particularly quantitative that we're sharing right now.  \\nI think there are different efficiency opportunities with AI that we've been focused on in terms of where we can reduce costs over time and generate savings through increasing internal productivity in areas like coding.  \\nFor example, it's early, but we're seeing a lot of adoption internally of our internal assistant and coding agent, and we continue to make Llama more effective at coding, which should also make this use case increasingly valuable to developers over time.  \\nOperator:  \\nRoss Sandler:  \\nThere are also places where we hope over time that we'll be able to deploy these tools against a lot of our content moderation efforts to help make the big body of content moderation work that we undertake, to help make it more efficient and effective for us to do so.  \\nAnd there are lots of other places around the company where I would say we're relatively early in exploring the way that we can use LLM based tools to make different types of work streams more efficient. So all that is to say, it's something we're pretty excited about.  \\nWe have lots of teams focused on it. There are sort of small opportunities and G&amp;A functions to what we hope will be big opportunities in areas like content moderation and coding productivity over time.  \\nOn your second question about headcount, we're really --again, we're still mid -budget. So there's --we don't have very much that is definitive to share about this at the time. But as we're evaluating where there are opportunities for us to make good investments, we really think about there is a bucket of very ROIdriven headcount opportunities.  \\nWe're very rigorous about the way we think about returns there and what the return opportunity is and how -- what we think is the likelihood of those returns and what is the aggregate incrementality of those investments, and those are all things that sort of we're evaluating when we think about where to invest in the core business and where we think we can -- we can deliver sort of ROI on a nearer-term basis.  \\nAnd then at the same time, we're also assessing what the opportunities look like in some of the more medium- and long-term strategic areas of investment and that includes our efforts in Gen AI and the infrastructure needed to support it.  \\nIt includes our investments in Reality Labs. And so those are all things that we're kind of assessing in kind of a portfolio of what we could -- what we think we would do in 2025. With a couple of thoughts, one is, again, where can we sort of build the mo st flexibility into the way that we're thinking about either infrastructure or headcount plans.  \\nAnd the second is we're really focused across the company on our efficiency efforts broadly and making sure that we feel like we're continuing to push the whole company including areas in which we expect that we will be making additional headcount investments to think about how they can be more efficient in '25 than they were in '24.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.  \\nGreat. Just two quick ones, Mark. You said something along the lines of the more standardized Llama becomes the more improvements will flow back to the core Meta business. And I guess, could you just dig in a little bit more on  \\nthat? So the series of Llama models are being used by lots of developers building different things in AI.  \\nI guess, how are you using that vantage point to incubate new ideas inside Meta? And then second question is, you mentioned on one of the podcasts after the Meta Connect that assuming scaling laws hold up, we may need hundreds of billions of compute CapEx to kind of reach our goals around Gen AI.  \\nSo I guess, how quickly could you conceivably stand up that much infrastructure given some of the constraints around energy or custom ASICs or other factors? Just any more color on the speed by which we could get that amount of compute online at Meta? Thank you.  \\nMark Zuckerberg:  Yes. I can try to give some more color on this. I mean the improvements to Llama, I'd say come in a couple of flavors. There's sort of the quality flavor and the efficiency flavor.  \\nThere are a lot of researchers and independent developers who do work and because Llama is available, they do the work on Llama and they make improvements and then they publish it and it becomes -it's very easy for us to then incorporate that both back into Llama and into our Meta products like Meta AI or AI Studio or Business AIs because the work -- the examples that are being shown are people doing it on our stack.  \\nPerhaps more importantly is just the efficiency and cost. I mean this stuff is obviously very expensive. When someone figures out a way to run this better, if that -- if they can run it 20% more effectively, then that will save us a huge amount of money.  \\nAnd that was sort of the experience that we had with Open Compute and why - part of why we are leaning so much into Open Source here in the first place, is that we found counterintuitively with Open Compute that by publishing and sharing the architectures and designs that we had for our compute, the industry standardized around it a bit more.  \\nWe got some suggestions also that helped us save costs and that just ended up being really valuable for us. Here, one of the big costs is chips -- a lot of the infrastructure there.  \\nWhat we're seeing is that as Llama gets adopted more, you're seeing folks like NVIDIA and AMD optimize their chips more to run Llama specifically well which clearly benefits us.  \\nSo it benefits everyone who's using Llama, but it makes our products better, right, rather than if we were just on an island building a model that no one was kind of standardizing around in the industry.  \\nSo that's some of what we're seeing around Llama and why I think it's good business for us to do this in an open way.  \\nOperator:  \\nRonald Josey:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nIn terms of scaling infra, I mean when I talk about our teams executing well, some of that goes towards delivering more engaging products and some of it goes towards delivering more revenue.  \\nOn the infra side, it goes towards building out the expenses faster, right? So I think part of what we're seeing this year is the infra team is executing quite well. And I think that's why, over the course of the year, we've been able to build out more capacity.  \\nI mean going into the year, we had a range for what we thought we could potentially do. And we have been able to do, I think, more than, I think, we'd kind of hoped and expected at the beginning of the year.  \\nAnd while that reflects as higher expenses, it's actually something that I'm quite happy that the team is executing well on. And I think that will -- so that execution makes me somewhat more optimistic that we're going to be able to keep on building this out at a good pace but that's part of th is whole thing. This is -- this part of the formula around kind of building out the infrastructure is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term that we're growing it out.  \\nBut I just think that the opportunities here are really big. We're going to continue investing significantly in this. And I'm proud of the teams that are doing great work to stand up a large amount of capacity so that way we can deliver world-class models and world-class products.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.  \\nGreat, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a bigger picture one as well, Mark, just this time on Threads. Now one of the core apps, and on it's way to becoming the next major social app and 275 million MAUs.  \\nI wanted to hear your thoughts on how this product evolves over time, specifically from a monetization perspective, but also next steps on users? And then, Susan, with pricing up 11% in the quarter, I wanted to hear more about the pricing dynamics on the platform.  \\nI think you talked about just pricing increasing due to greater advertising demand and improved ad performance. So help us understand that a little bit more. Thank you.  \\nThanks, Ron. So your first question was about Threads. We're making good progress there. We are continuing to launch more features and make improvements to our ranking stack. We feel very good about the continued user growth on Threads.  \\nWe're bringing on an increasing number of users each quarter and depth of engagement also continues to grow. And in Q3, we saw especially strong user  \\ngrowth in key markets like the U.S., Taiwan and Japan. And we -we've added a number of new features over the course of Q3 including account insights for businesses and creators to see how they're post s perform, the ability to save multiple drafts, continuing to deliver on our commitment to integrate Threads with the Fediverse and basically, we're very focused on continuing to build out the sort of functionality of Threads over time and being responsive to what users tell us that they're interested in.  \\nSpecifically, as it pertains to monetization, we don't expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue at this time.  \\nWe've been just pleased with the growth trajectory and again, are really focused on introducing features that the community finds valuable and working to deepen growth and engagement. Your second question was about the increase in average price per ad.  \\nSo that grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong advertiser demand and part of that is because of better ad performance over time also. And we saw that CPM growth accelerate slightly from 10% in Q2, in part because we experienced lower impression growth in Q3.  \\nBut more broadly, as we think about pricing growth and this metric, the yearoveryear growth in reported price per ad, there's a lot that goes into that including the auction dynamics resulting from fluctuations and impression growth. And one of the thin gs that we feel like we're very focused on is really the input metrics.  \\nWhat are the conversions that we are delivering to advertisers? Are they getting more value over time? The sort of blended reported price per ad is complicated because all of those things get rolled up into it.  \\nThere are so many different objectives that advertisers are optimizing for, those objectives have very different values that make them hard to compare on an apples-to-apples basis.  \\nBut we care a lot about conversion growth, which is growing, continues to grow faster than impression growth. And are we seeing healthy cost per action or cost per conversion trends, which we are. And as long as we continue to get better at driving conversions for advertisers, that should have the effect of lifting CPMs over time, because we're delivering more conversions per impressions served and that will result in higher value impressions.  \\nOperator:  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.  \\nKenneth Gawrelski:  \\nThanks for the opportunity. I appreciate that. I have a bigger picture kind of like ecosystem question here. Is -- when we think -I'm curious, how far do you think we are from seeing a proliferation of third-party AI applications, spec ifically on the kind of the consumer side? I know we're seeing more and more on the enterprise side, agents, et cetera.  \\nMark Zuckerberg:  \\nOperator:  \\nYoussef Squali:  \\nBut when do we see -- how far out until we see a proliferation of consumer applications in the AI space? And how would you think about -- and how does Meta think of itself as one of those key applications in the mobile internet and the desktop internet? But now you're also seemingly an infrastructure pla yer as well. So I'd love to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.  \\nYes. I mean there are a lot of consumer products that we're working on. And with Llama, I would expect that app developers will be able to build a lot of really good things, too.  \\nI've touched on Meta AI and AI Studio and Business AI s a bunch, and I expect those to be important parts of the consumer experience. Another part that I haven't talked about quite as much yet is the opportunity for AI to help people create content that just makes people's feed experiences better.  \\nIf you look at the big trends in Feeds over the history of the company, it started off as friends, right? So all the updates that were in there were basically from your friends posting things. And then we went into this era where we added in creator content too, where now a very large percent of the content on Instagram and Facebook is not from your friends.  \\nIt may not even be from people that you're following directly. It could just be recommended content from creators that we can algorithmically determine is going to be interesting and engaging and valuable to you.  \\nAnd I think we're going to add a whole new category of content, which is AI generated or AI summarized content or kind of existing content pulled together by AI in some way. And I think that that's going to be just very exciting for the -- for Facebook and Instagram and maybe Threads or other kind of Feed experiences over time.  \\nIt's something that , we're starting to test different things around this. I don't know if we know exactly what's going to work really well yet. Some things are promising. I don't know that --this isn't going to be a big impact on the business in '25 would be my guess.  \\nBut I think that there is -- I have high confidence that over the next several years, this is going to be an important trend and one of the important applications. But you're going to get that, you're going to get Meta AI, AI Studio, business AIs and a whole lot of things that developers would do with Llama too.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.  \\nYes, thank you very much. Mark, it appears that Meta AI now crawls the web and provides conversational answers about pretty much anything including current events. And so with over ten million advertisers and one of the best ROAS offerings out there in your core business, just wondering if there are any  \\nSusan Li:  \\nKenneth Dorell:  \\nOperator:  \\nMark Mahaney:  \\nplans to start maybe testing ads on commercial queries, and move Meta AI closer to becoming a real answer engine for the billions of queries that you guys are already seeing?  \\nAnd then Susan, one of the biggest areas of pushback we get is around Reality Labs and the ongoing losses there, I think $16 billion last year, probably north of $20 billion this year. The question is, are we getting any closer to peak losses there or alternatively, what products do you think have the biggest potential there over the next couple of years? Thanks.  \\nI'm happy to take both of these, Youssef. So your first question was on plans to provide ads on commercial queries. I think I alluded to this maybe in a much earlier question. Right now, we're really focused on making Meta AI as engaging and valuable a consumer experience as possible.  \\nOver time, we think there will be a broadening set of queries that people use it for. And I think that the monetization opportunities will exist when -- over time as we get there.  \\nBut right now, I would say we are really focused on the consumer experience above all and this is sort of a playbook for us with products that we put out in the world where we really dial in the consumer experience before we focus on what the monetization could look like. The second part of your question is about Reality Labs.  \\nWe aren't sharing expectations beyond 2024 at this point. And we are certainly as we think about the 2025 budgeting process for Reality Labs, we're certainly thinking about where we want to make sure we're putting our sort of focus and energy.  \\nWe are very excited, again, about the progress that we've seen with our smart glasses as well as the sort of strong consumer interest in them. And so, we're kind of thinking about where we want to make sure that we are investing appropriately behind the consumer momentum that we see.  \\nOverall, I'd say Reality Labs is clearly one of our strategic long -term priorities, and we expect it will be an area of significant investment in -- as we build out towards the very ambitious product roadmap that we have there.  \\nKrista, we have time for one last question.  \\nYour last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.  \\nLet me throw in two questions, please. One, this is a year in which we've had a lot of unusual events that could be driving ad revenue, major elections in not just the U.S., but Europe and in India and major sports events like World Cup and I know there's some other thing s.  \\nSusan Li:  \\nIs there any -- just in thinking about comps for next year and maybe in the future, anything Susan, you would call out, like how much of an impact there may have come from these one in every four or five-year events? And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit more about WhatsApp monetization and where you are with that now?  \\nIt sounds like the business messaging part is really feeding in nicely into other revenue. But help us think about where the monetization levels of WhatsApp are now versus where they can be two or three years down the road, how far away we are from optimization? Thank you.  \\nThanks, Mark. So your first question was about sort of the revenue backdrop in 2024, you mentioned events that occur once every four or five years. So I imagine we're talking about the Olympics. We historically have not seen meaningful incremental contribution from events like the Olympics. We believe that was largely the case this year.  \\nSo when we think about the Q4 outlook and when we think about going into next year, we generally expect growth to continue to benefit from the healthy global advertising demand that we've seen.  \\nWe think that our investments in improving our ads performance will continue to accrue benefits to advertisers. But obviously, there's a big range of possible macro backdrops and that's something that we try to reflect in the range of revenue guidance that we give.  \\nSo -but I don't know that there are a lot of specific events that we would say had a material sort of idiosyncratic to 2024 type of revenue impact. Your second question was around WhatsApp monetization and where we are. And right now what I would say, again, is Click-to-Message is really the big focus area for us here.  \\nWe're seeing continued traction in this area. And in particular, growth in Click -toWhatsApp Ads remain particularly strong. And so we're continuing to focus both on scaling Click-to-WhatsApp Ads in more markets where WhatsApp has strong user adoption like Brazil, for example.  \\nIt's obviously earlier in the U.S., but we're seeing good growth in Click -toWhatsApp Ads and are continuing to invest in scaling and consumer adoption of WhatsApp in the U.S. also, which will create bigger opportunities down the line.  \\nSo -and then, of course, a lot of work that we're doing to make the Click -toMessaging ads more effective and helping to focus for the particular -- helping advertisers optimize, sorry, for the particular conversion events that they care about.  \\nThe other element of revenue on WhatsApp, I would say, is paid messaging. That continues to grow at a strong pace again this quarter.  \\nKenneth Dorell:  \\nOperator:  \\nIt remains, in fact, the primary driver of growth in our Family of Apps other revenue line, which was up 48% in Q3, and we're seeing generally a strong increase in the volume of paid conversations driven both by growth in the number of businesses adopting paid messaging as well as in the conversational volume per business.  \\nGreat. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time. And we look forward to speaking with you again soon.  \\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\"),\n",

And your first question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please go ahead.  \\nYes.  Hi.  Thanks for taking the questions. Susan, a couple.  Just I appreciate the kind of color around the engagement traction with Meta AI against kind of the 500 million MAUs.  Wanted to think about how the engagement is growing relative to kind of the MAU number, something like a WAU/MAU.  \\nKenneth Dorell:  \\nOperator:  \\nMark Shmulik:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nOperator:  \\nColin Sebastian:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nKenneth Dorell:  \\nAnd then second question is a bit more mechanical.  Just on the guidance around the tax rate, how do we think about that just kind of going forward into 2025 and some of the puts and takes around that?  Thanks.  \\nThanks, Mark.  So your first question was around more color on engagement relative to Meta AI.  \\nSo I don't think we have shared the kind of retention metrics that you are describing, sort of like daily or weekly actives relative to monthly actives.  I think we've been talking about it more qualitatively so far.  \\nW e're happy with the growth overall.  We're continuing to see particularly promising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement.  India is and remains our largest market for Meta AI usage.  \\nAnd it's interesting because we see that people engage with Meta AI from a variety of different entry points.  The deepest engagement occurs via messaging, although we also are seeing some strong traction with Feed deep dives.  And people are also using it in group chats and creating images to share as posts or stories.  \\nYour second question was around tax.  I don't think we have given an outlook beyond Q4 and we shared that our Q4 tax rate will also be in the low teens.  \\nOne of the things that is an interesting dynamic in our tax rate is our tax rate tends to be reduced when our share price increases.  That's because the tax deduction for RSUs that we issue as compensation is based on the vesting value while GAAP recognizes the expense based on the grant value.  \\nSo you saw that our tax rate through 2024 has been lower relative to what it was in 2023, and that, in part, reflects a higher share price than we had in '23 and also, in part, due to some R&amp;D tax credits this year.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.  Please go ahead.  \\nThanks, guys, for taking the questions. I guess, Susan, first, on the decision not to provide more details on 2025 spending, how much of that, I guess, if you could elaborate, is really just digesting some of the near-term resources that need to be put to work on all these initiatives?  Or is more an effort to drive more efficiency or find more ways to find efficiency I guess in the business?  \\nThanks, Colin. So I believe we previewed several quarters ago the decision to switch when we give forward-year guidance from what was historically this call, so the October or Q3 call, to the Q4 or January call.  I think maybe we even previewed that a year ago?  \\nA year ago.  \\nSusan Li:  \\nOperator:  \\nJames Lee:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nIt was a year ago.  Yes. So that's been a long awaited change. But the reason we made that change back then is because our budgeting process is quite dynamic and we found that we really just had a much higher fidelity guidance by the time that we were done with the budget, which gets wrapped at the end of the year rather than kind of in this October like midway point.  \\nSo, that's really the sort of -- the change in timing was because of the timing of our budgeting processes and we previewed that a year ago.  \\nHaving said that, you know, we have spoken a bit qualitatively about the shape of 2025 planning.  We have talked about the growth and CapEx that we expect, you know, given the sort of capacity ambitions that we have and what we're building in order to fuel sort of our AI and non-AI work for next year.  \\nAnd then we've also talked about -- Mark gave some color in his remarks and I spoke a bit about this also on how we're thinking about the headcount planning process, where we think we want to make sure that we're investing appropriately to sort of maximize the opportunities for return across a portfolio of projects.  \\nSo, and I think both he and alluded to where those priority areas are and how there's kind of an ROI bucket that we think about and what the strategic bucket looks like.  So, all of that will factor into the final 2025 budget, and then correspondingly the guidance that we give in the January '25 call.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho.  Please go ahead.  \\nGreat, thanks for taking my question.  Susan, I was wondering if you can give us an update maybe on AI agents of business.  Any update for potential commercial launches for Messenger or maybe WhatsApp?  I think last quarter you talked about testing business agent in Southeast Asia and India.  And just wondering, do you have anything new to call out?  Thanks.  \\nYes, thanks, James.  So, we're continuing to progress with of tests of AI agents.  It remains very early but we've recently just expanded availability to businesses using Click-to-Message ads on WhatsApp and Messenger in English across a handful of markets, I think the focus has been still primarily in Asia, I think India and Singapore on WhatsApp, and the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and the UAE on Messenger.  \\nOur focus has been to start to support shopping use cases such as responding to people who are asking for more information about a product or about its availability.  We're also expanding to support (lead gen) to help businesses generate high-quality leads.  \\nBut we're very, very early.  This is a place where I would say we are really focused on learning from these tests, in terms of what makes the business AI agents most effective and what makes them -- how the businesses who deploy  \\nKenneth Dorell:  \\nthem are measuring success and how we can drive the most value with this use case.  \\nSo, again, this is very early in our journey.  There is a lot that we're working on going forward; the response quality we expect will continue to improve both with our ongoing work along with the next generation of Llama models.  \\nWe expect the scaling to languages beyond English will be an important part of the growth here going forward.  And ultimately, also expanding the types of responses that business AIs can support, improving the quality of those responses and fine-tuning the responses based on what we learn from kind of the current test data, and building richer in-thread experiences.  \\nSo, all this is to say there is a lot of work that is underway, but the long road of the business AI journey is ahead of us.  \\nKrista, can we go to the next question?  \\nOperator:  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Moffett Nathanson.  Please go ahead.  \\nMichael Nathanson:  \\nThank you.  Susan, I have one hard one and one easier one. I wonder when you talked about the near-term opportunities to improve recommendation and then monetization, how quickly do you think you see the ROI on that CapEx spend ?  Is there anything you've done on kind of when do we start seeing it, perhaps the results or something there?  \\nAnd then the easier one is think about the CapEx spend this year.  Is there anything you can help us with between maybe shorter cycle depreciation like servers versus how much of this spend, percentage wise, will be on longer cycle things like infrastructure?  So anything there would be helpful. Thanks.  \\nSusan Li:  \\nThanks, Michael.  So across the set of things that we're investing in with our AI investments, with our core AI work, we've talked a lot historically about how we have a very ROI-based approach to our investments here.  \\nWe're still seeing strong returns as improvements to both engagement and ad performance translate to revenue gains.  I think Mark mentioned that this year the ranking improvements we've made have delivered an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram.  \\nAnd there are a number of other opportunities across our core AI work that we see to continue delivering good ROI against those investments.  \\nAnd the Gen AI work, obviously, is much earlier, but even then, we expect they're going to open up avenues for us to accrue value to different parts of our business, with those happening along different timeframes, too.  \\nAnd so, in the Core Ads business, the Gen AI tools that we have built here that will help us enable businesses to make ads significantly more customized at  \\nChad Heaton:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nscale, which is going to accrue to ad performance, that's a place where, again, we're already seeing promising results in both performance gains and adoption. I think we shared that over a million advertisers use our Gen AI ad tools specifically.  \\nSo there are a lot of opportunities even in the sort of nearer-term roadmap for the deployment of Gen AI tools and technologies to make the Core Ads business better, again, that we're excited about in the nearer term.  \\nSo I would say there are a good number of opportunities of that nature core AI ranking, recommendation, improvements and deployments of Gen AI within the Core Ads business that we expect are going to deliver ROI well before some of the longer-term Gen AI bets around business messaging, Meta AI, et cetera. So that's the first question.  Your second question is…  \\nYes.  I'll pick up the second question about your infra CapEx. So I think Susan mentioned here, we're still working through our 2025 infrastructure plan, but at this point we expect total infrastructure spend within each of non-Gen AI, Gen AI, and core AI to increase in 2025.  \\nWe expect servers will be the largest driver of growth in 2025 and remain the largest portion of our overall CapEx budget, though we also expect higher spend in data centers and network equipment as we continue to just scale our overall infra footprint.  \\nAs I mentioned, servers are going to be the largest driver of growth.  We expect growth in non-AI capacity as we invest in the core business, including to support a higher base of engagement as well as refreshing existing servers, as well as AI capacity as we scale Gen AI training and continue to invest meaningfully in core AI.  \\nWe do anticipate data center spend to be higher in 2025, primarily due to us entering the core construction phase of our smaller, higher-density data centers that we've discussed previously.  And we're building higher capacity networks to accommodate the growth in Gen AI and Core AI-related traffic in 2025, along with investing in fiber to handle future cross-region training traffic. So, those are some of the drivers that we'll be expecting on the infra side in 2025.  \\nAnd, actually, just before we move on, I want to come back to my first answer. I realize I kind of answered more with a focus on the monetization bit specifically.  You also asked about recommendations and I wanted to sort of elaborate here and to just say, we think that we have actually a lot of opportunity to improve recommendations, both in near-term and longer-term projects.  But some of the nearer-term opportunities are really around relevance gains as we scale our models for content recommendation.  \\nSo the first is increasing model complexity.  That's going to enable us to learn more from the same data with more compute.  And the second is expanding data sets so that we can learn from more data.  And we're also just making a lot  \\nOperator:  \\nDaniel Salmon:  \\nChad Heaton:  \\nof optimizations to the existing recommendation systems that help drive incremental improvements and efficiency.  \\nSo, on Instagram in Q3, for example, we completed infra-efficiency projects that consolidated some of our existing recommendation systems, that lets us concentrate our future improvements on a smaller number of recommendation models, it drives higher engineering efficiency going forward.  \\nAnd then in the longer term, there are a lot of new model architectures we're working on.  We have benefitted, frankly, over the past few years from integrating new model architecture into the Facebook Reels recommendation system.  We talked about the watch time gains last year when we switched from CPUs to GPUs for Facebook Reels.  And we're continuing to explore how to, basically, integrate these types of models to the recommendation systems for other surfaces.  \\nAnd again, I think that is a place where we expect that we will be able to make our recommendation systems deliver more relevant and interesting content. And that, again, is something that is, for us, we are able to measure how effectively we can do that and how much we can drive growth and engagement over time.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Daniel Salmon with New Street Research.  Please go ahead.  \\nGood afternoon, everyone.  Susan, on the call, you called out the growing use of Advantage+ creative tools and a wider expansion for them coming next year. How would you compare the revenue potential of that module or tactic to the impact that you've seen from Advantage+ shopping campaigns, which you noted is driving over $10 billion of revenue a few quarters ago? And then just second, any quick update on the traction for Advantage+ app campaigns that you're seeing?  Thanks.  \\nYes, I can share a little bit about Advantage+.  We are seeing continued growth with our single step and our end-to-end automated solutions, that includes Advantage+ shopping, and as you mentioned, Advantage+ app campaigns.  On the Advantage+ shopping side, growth remains really strong.  \\nWe've seen increased adoption since we rolled out the extended list of conversions businesses can optimize for in Q2.  On the Advantage+ app ads, we're seeing growing adoption of app campaigns and particularly a success in the gaming vertical, which is a stronger vertical for app objectives in general.  \\nIn Q3, we continued testing a new end-to-end automation solution that supports lead-gen campaigns.  So, Advantage+ lead campaigns are sort of similar to Advantage+ shopping campaigns.  It enables advertisers to apply AI to multiple campaign levers at once for ads using the lead's objective, including audience-created placements and budget.  \\nOperator:  \\nShweta Khajuria:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nChad Heaton:  \\nOperator:  \\nRohit Kulkarni:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nSo overall we continue to see a lot of opportunity in our Advantage+ suite of solutions.  We also expect the features that we're introducing to drive results more customized to each business objectives, like conversion value rules, will enable us to better optimize AIenabled campaigns.  So yes, overall it's going really well and continues to be a driver of our business.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research.  Please go ahead.  \\nThank you so much for taking my question.  Is it possible to talk about the DAP result in this quarter, anything in particular, did it come in ahead, in line, or below your expectations?  And something -- because it also impacts impressions growth, so any color on that would be great, thank you.  \\nI mentioned this on the call, but we continue to see daily usage grow year over year across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in Q3, both globally and in the U.S., so we feel good about the engagement trends overall both from a usage perspective, as well as deeper engagement metrics in the way people spend time on the platform, and also our ability to continue to improve our ranking systems and deliver good content and video recommendations that make people's experien ces more interesting and valuable.  \\nAnd then in terms of impressions, we had 7% year over year impression growth that was driven by users, as Susan mentioned, but also video engagement growth across Facebook and Instagram.  \\nSo I think we felt good about the impression growth.  As we're looking forward into 2025, we continue to see impression growth opportunities through engagement growth and ongoing ad load optimizations for our video products. So yes, we're feeling good abo ut the opportunities here.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Rohit Kulkarni with Roth Capital. Please go ahead.  \\nHey, thank you, couple of questions, one on depreciation and the lifetime of servers.  I think you guys are the only ones who are depreciating it over five years, most of the servers and networking equipment -- a few of your peers are extending lives to six years.  So maybe talk about the decision-making behind that.  \\nAnd second is on Reality Labs and the OpEx for Reality Labs.  It has consistently increased as a percentage of overall OpEx. With Orion out there, the hypothesis is that perhaps the velocity of spend may start to slow down a little bit.  Would love to get your reaction to that as well as how do you think about the decision-making around increasing OpEx from Reality Labs into the next couple years?  \\nThank you, Rohit.  So the first question around useful lives on servers, we don't currently have plans to extend the useful lives of our servers.  That's really because, given the ongoing performance gains from new generations of GPU-  \\nChad Heaton:  \\nSusan Li:  \\nOperator:  \\nJason Helfstein:  \\nbased servers, we really want to make sure that we are making the best use of the capacity available in our data centers by using the latest generation of servers.  \\nBut we do periodically evaluate server useful life, and when we do, we'll take into consideration the historical data of how long we used them for and future looking data on server retirement plans.  But again, no current plans to extend the useful lives of our servers.  The second question you had was around…  \\nReality Labs.  \\nReality Labs and the way we think about the investment in Reality Labs. I would say we are -- we have a really big investment portfolio here.  It is multifaceted across both the current and next generation of hardware devices and software.  \\nIn the nearterm, we're really focused on growing adoption of our existing products.  We want to accelerate the adoption of products like the Ray-Ban Metas that we've seen have very strong product market fit and that, frankly, we think are accelerating the timeline on sort of bringing AR glasses to market and are just an extremely natural form factor for a lot of our AI tools.  \\nYou kind of talked about Orion, and much of our investment, of course, is in areas that are not currently reflected in products on the market.  There's still a lot to do around conducting the fundamental R&amp;D to invest and productize and scale new technologies.  And there is certainly a lot we need to do on Orion before we think it's ready to be a product that we would bring to market in terms of making both the actual display quality better, the form factor more comfortable, and making it more affordable to build at scale.  \\nSo there is -it's just a big portfolio in Reality Labs.  It's a place where , while the ambitions are significant and, again, span a lot of products, it's also a place where we're focused on efficiency, too, and that is definitely a part of the budget conversation, which is where are the places where we can be more efficient in Reality Labs such that we have room to expand our ambitions around things like smart glasses and accelerate bringing those to market and trying to find tradeoffs as we think about the Reality Labs portfolio.  \\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.  \\nThanks for taking the questions. I just want to ask a bit about gross margin. With the significant CapEx year-todate and at the end of last year, you've been able to offset that as far as impact on gross margin through just really strong revenue.  I mean, obviously you're not going to give us guidance, but should we start to think about gross margin being negatively impacted by kind of CapEx?  \\nAnd I don't know if it specifically starts in fourth quarter, but as we move through next year, just maybe how should we think about gross margin I guess  \\nSusan Li:  \\nKenneth Dorell:  \\nOperator:  \\nJim:  \\nChad Heaton:  \\ngoing forward? And then just quick housekeeping and you may have said it in the main call and I missed it, but just why did G&amp;A step down by like a little less than $2 billion sequentially?  Thanks.  \\nYes.  I'll get to your G&amp;A question first. So the decrease in G&amp;A, that really was driven primarily by lower legalrelated expenses.  There's kind of lumpiness in G&amp;A on a quarter-to-quarter basis due to the nature of legal accruals and expenses, and in Q3 we just didn't have the same level of legal -related expenses that we had in the first two quarters of the year.  \\nAnd then your first question about gross margins, obviously there are multiple components.  We've talked about the depreciation expenses that we expect to accelerate significantly as the impact of the CapEx build to date and next year's incremental CapEx flow through.  \\nThe cost structure, we're not breaking that out specifically between cost revenue and R&amp;D, but we're generally investing across our infrastructure fleet and the cost of revenue, infrastructure costs do capture all the depreciation and OpEx of our infra op erations outside of what's used for AI research.  So, that's the sort of piece that is specific to Gen AI training, Reality Labs, and FAIR and that goes into the R&amp;D bucket instead.  And then, of course, how successfully we're able to deliver returns and d rive revenue growth in 2025.  \\nKrista, we have time for one last question.  \\nYour last question comes from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.  \\nHi, thanks, this is Jim on for Tom.  Appreciate you guys taking the question. Gaming was called as a vertical of strength, not this quarter but for, I think, the four quarters prior.  Would be curious kind of what drove that and maybe why that wasn't a driver of strength in this quarter.  And then, secondly, would just be curious to kind of hear the status of the Messaging business in the U.S. and the ambitions there.  Thank you.  \\nOn verticals, we don't typically call out -- we usually focus on which were our drivers of strength.  We called the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth.  That was followed by healthcare and then entertainment and media verticals.  I can share a little bit more about those.  \\nOnline commerce, the growth remained healthy but slowed from Q2, primarily due to lapping accelerating growth from China-based advertisers from a year ago.  On the healthcare side, it was one of our fastest growing verticals in Q3. We saw broad-based strength across advertiser regions with particular strength in North America.  \\nAnd then on entertainment and media, again, saw strong year-over-year growth there.  It was driven by broad-based strength across North America and Asia-based advertisers, particularly from China.  So gaming still is an important  \\nSusan Li:  \\nKenneth Dorell:  \\nOperator:  \\nvertical for us but it just wasn't one of the biggest contributors in this most recent quarter.  \\nAnd on your first -- second question, sorry.  Status of the Messaging business in the U.S.  I think we talked about this maybe a little bit on one of the earlier questions.  We are really focused on scaling Click-to-Message ads across the two levers of both broadening adoption in more markets as well as facilitating more down funnel conversions.  \\nOn that market piece, it is earlier in the U.S.  We are seeing good growth in Click-to-WhatsApp ads.  And that is a place where we are continuing to invest in scaling consumer adoption of WhatsApp and that's going to create a bigger opportunity for us with the Click-to-WhatsApp business in the U.S., also focusing on down funnel objectives just continues to make those ads more generally performant and is certainly something that also is, I think, especially valuable to more sophisticated advertisers.  \\nSo it's still early.  But our ambitions there are that we are going to invest a lot here.  I t's a market that we care a lot about and we know that there is a strong business Messaging ecosystem in other markets and we want to do everything we can to replicate that success in developed markets like the U.S. and Western Europe.  \\nGreat.  Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.  We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.  \\nThis concludes today's conference call.  Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.\"),\n",

The  EC  decision imposed  a  €2.4  billion  ($2.7  billion  as  of  June  27,  2017)  fine.  We  appealed  the  EC  decision  and implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and upheld the €2.4 billion fine imposed in 2017. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.\\n- · On  July  18,  2018,  the  EC  announced  its  decision  that  certain  provisions  in  Google's  Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution  practices.  On  September  14,  2022,  the  General  Court  reduced  the  fine  from  €4.3  billion  to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\\n- · On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google  had  with  AdSense  for  Search  partners  infringed  European  competition  law.  The  EC  decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the  EC  decision.  We  recognized  a  charge  of  $1.7  billion  for  the  fine  in  the  first  quarter  of  2019.  On September 18, 2024, the European Union's (EU) General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.  \\nIn addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.  \\nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google . The jury found that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision on October 7, 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a motion  to  pause  the  implementation  of  some  of  the  remedies  pending  the  appeal.  The  trial  court  judge  has temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal.  \\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their nature we cannot estimate a possible loss include:  \\n- · In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and on August 5, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being  held  to  determine  remedies,  the  range  of  which  vary  widely.  The  DOJ  has  proposed  a  high  level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations,  including  structural  remedies,  and/or  our  distribution  arrangements,  among  other  changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Further, in June 2022, the Australian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (ACCC)  and  the  United  Kingdom's  Competition  and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.  \\n- · On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for  the  Eastern  District  of  Texas,  alleging  that  Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  as  well  as  state deceptive  trade  laws  relating  to  its  advertising  technology,  and  a  trial  is  scheduled  for  March  2025. Additionally,  on  January  24,  2023,  the  DOJ,  along  with  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General,  filed  an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google's digital advertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint. The trial ended on September 27, 2024, and we expect a decision in late 2024 or early 2025. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into  Google's  advertising  technology  business  practices  on  June  22,  2021,  May  25,  2022,  and  June  29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary  view  that  Google  violated  European  antitrust  laws  relating  to  its  advertising  technology.  We responded  to  the  SO  on  December  1,  2023.  On  September  6,  2024,  the  CMA  issued  an  SO  informing Google  of  its  preliminary  view  that  Google  violated  UK  competition  laws  relating  to  its  advertising technology. We will respond to the SO.\\n- · In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play's business practices. The EC closed its initial investigation, but is now investigating Google Play's compliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.  \\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\"),\n",

As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market,  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us,  including  preventing  us  from  importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.  \\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims,  which  would  increase  our  costs  as  a  result  of  defending  such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims.

We  use  non-GAAP  constant  currency  revenues  (\"constant  currency  revenues\")  and  non-GAAP percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues  (\"percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues\")  for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.  \\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period  over  period.  We  define  constant  currency  revenues  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  currency exchange rate  movements  (\"FX  Effect\")  as  well  as  hedging  activities,  which  are  recognized  at  the  consolidated level.  We  use  constant  currency  revenues  to  determine  the  constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  on  a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.  \\nConstant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  is  calculated  by  determining  the  change  in  current  period revenues  over  prior  year  comparable  period  revenues  where  current  period  foreign  currency  revenues  are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.  \\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.  Results  on  a  constant  currency  basis,  as  we  present  them,  may  not  be  comparable  to  similarly  titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.  \\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in millions, except percentages):  \\n|

RISK FACTORS  \\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,  2023,  as  updated  in  our  subsequent  Quarterly  Reports  on  Form  10-Q,  which  could  harm  our  business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.  \\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations,  enforcement  actions,  consent  orders,  and  other  forms  of  regulatory  scrutiny  and  legal liability, including competition matters, that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.  \\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.  \\nThe DOJ, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file in the future, several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store.  \\nFor example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google violated antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. The Court is holding a separate proceeding to determine remedies, which could include alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal, there can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of  any  remedies  that  may  be  ordered,  and  any  or  all  of  these  potential  remedies  could  harm  our  business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.  \\nAlso,  in  December  2023,  a  California  jury  delivered  a  verdict  in Epic Games v. Google finding  that  Google violated  antitrust  laws  related  to  Google  Play\\'s  business.  The  presiding  judge  issued  a  remedies  decision  on October  7,  2024  that  ordered  a  variety  of  alterations  to  our  business  models  and  operations  and  contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a motion to pause the implementation of some of the remedies pending the appeal, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal or in our efforts to pause the implementation of the remedies pending the appeal. If we are unsuccessful, we could face  significant  expenses  to  implement  the  remedies,  and  such  costs  and  alterations  could  harm  our  business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.  \\nOther  regulatory  agencies  in  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world,  including  competition  enforcers,  consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.  \\nWe are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation,  negligence,  breaches  of  contract,  patent,  copyright  and  trademark  infringement,  unfair  competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information  available  on  or  via  our  services,  the  design  and  effect  of  our  products  and  services,  or  due  to  our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties.  \\nVarious  laws,  regulations,  investigations,  enforcement  lawsuits,  and  regulatory  actions  have  involved  in  the past, and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations,  changes  to  our  products  and  services,  alterations  to  our  business  models  and  operations,  including divestiture,  and  collateral  related  civil  litigation  or  other  adverse  consequences. Any  of  these  legal  proceedings could also result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, and negative publicity, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.  \\nEstimating  liabilities  for  our  pending  proceedings  is  a  complex,  fact-specific,  and  speculative  process  that requires  significant  judgment,  and  the  amounts  we  are  ultimately  liable  for  may  be  less  than  or  exceed  our estimates.  The  resolution  of  one  or  more  such  proceedings  has  resulted  in,  and  may  in  the  future  result  in, additional  substantial  fines,  penalties,  injunctions,  and  other  sanctions  that  could  harm  our  business,  reputation, financial condition, and operating results.  \\nFor additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.'),\n",
