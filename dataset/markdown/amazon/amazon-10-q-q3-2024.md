## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(unaudited)

## Note 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES

## Unaudited Interim Financial Information

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2024 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP') have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Prior Period Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 'Other assets' were reclassified out of 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

## Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the 'Company'), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our health care services. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for Q3 2024, based on servers that were included in 'Property and equipment, net' as of June 30, 2024 and those acquired during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $760 million and a benefit to net income of $598 million, or $0.06 per basic share and $0.06 per diluted share. The effect of this change in estimate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on servers that were included in 'Property and equipment, net' as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $2.4 billion and a benefit to net income of $1.9 billion, or $0.18 per basic share and $0.18 per diluted share.

## Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weightedaverage outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.

The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):

Included in 'Other income (expense), net' is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $1.2 billion and $(348) million in Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $926 million and $(1.9) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. ('Rivian'). As of September 30, 2024, we held 158 million shares of Rivian's Class A common stock, representing an approximate 16% ownership interest, and an approximate 15% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian's board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is

included in 'Marketable securities' on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $3.7 billion and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

## Inventories

Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

## Accounts Receivable, Net and Other

Included in 'Accounts receivable, net and other' on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers, as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, customer receivables, net, were $34.1 billion and $34.6 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $8.5 billion and $8.3 billion, seller receivables, net, were $1.0 billion and $60 million, and other receivables, net, were $3.3 billion and $3.0 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provided funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

## Digital Video and Music Content

Included in 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets are the total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music, which as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 were $17.4 billion and $19.8 billion. Total video and music expense was $4.6 billion and $5.0 billion in Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $13.0 billion and $14.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.

## Unearned Revenue

Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $20.9 billion, of which $12.5 billion was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Included in 'Other long-term liabilities' on our consolidated balance sheets was $5.7 billion and $7.0 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were approximately $164 billion as of September 30, 2024. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.9 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.

## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') amending existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with

## Table of Contents

early adoption permitted, and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our income tax disclosures.

## Note 2 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

## Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities

As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAArated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:

- Level 1Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
- Level 2Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
- Level 3Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.

We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

(1) The related unrealized gain (loss) recorded in 'Other income (expense), net' was $1.2 billion and $(145) million in Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $1.0 billion and $(1.8) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.

(2) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily as collateral for real estate, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, standby and trade letters of credit, and licenses of digital media content. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as 'Accounts receivable, net and other' and of twelve months or longer as non-current 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets. See 'Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies.'

The following table summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities as of September 30, 2024 (in millions):

Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have certain prepayment conditions.

## Non-Marketable Investments

We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, these warrants had a fair value of $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion, with gains and losses recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are classified as Level 2 and 3 assets.

As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, equity investments not accounted for under the equity-method and without readily determinable fair values had a carrying value of $754 million and $886 million, with adjustments recognized in 'Other income (expense), net' on our consolidated statements of operations.

In Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. The notes are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).' The notes are classified as Level 3 assets. We also have a commercial arrangement primarily for the provision of AWS cloud services, which includes the use of AWS chips.

## Note 3 - LEASES

We have entered into non-cancellable operating and finance leases for fulfillment network, data center, office, and physical store facilities as well as server and networking equipment, aircraft, and vehicles. Gross assets acquired under finance leases, including those where title transfers at the end of the lease, are recorded in 'Property and equipment, net' and were $62.5 billion and $59.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Accumulated amortization associated with finance leases was $44.7 billion and $43.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

(1) Includes non-cancellable financing obligations for fulfillment network and data center facilities. Excluding interest, current financing obligations of $271 million and $313 million are recorded within 'Accrued expenses and other' and $6.6 billion and $7.5 billion are recorded within 'Other long-term liabilities' as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 17.0 years and 16.4 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.1% and 2.9% as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content, procure energy, and license software that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. Renewable energy agreements based on actual generation without a fixed or minimum volume commitment are not included. These agreements also provide the right to receive renewable energy certificates for no additional consideration.

(3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction. Excludes approximately $6.3 billion of income tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any.

## Table of Contents

## Other Contingencies

We are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits, and monitoring or evaluating potential claims, related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically include (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, including as a result of evolving requirements imposed on marketplaces with respect to third-party sellers, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations.

## Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the matters described in Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings' of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, as supplemented by the following:

In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleged, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, each entitled 'Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol'; and 7,233,978, entitled 'Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.' The complaint sought an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In April 2024, a jury found that Amazon infringed the asserted patents and awarded Kove $525 million in damages. In August 2024, the court awarded Kove $148 million in pre-judgment interest. In September 2024, we filed a notice of appeal. We disagree with the jury's findings and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

Beginning in March 2020 with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington ('W.D. Wash.'), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon's stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon's stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another ecommerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in September 2023 in the W.D. Wash. alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace services, and unlawfully maintains those monopolies through anticompetitive practices relating to our pricing policies, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks injunctive and structural relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and costs. In May 2024, the Attorney General of Arizona filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County alleging that Amazon's practices related to pricing and the Featured Offers in its stores violate state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint also seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, civil penalties, and costs. Amazon's motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-Wilson in March 2022 and March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General's lawsuit in March 2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon's pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon's pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In August 2024, the DC Court of Appeals overturned a prior decision by the DC Superior Court dismissing the DC Attorney General's lawsuit and that case is now proceeding. In September 2024, the United States District Court for the W.D. Wash. granted in part Amazon's motion to dismiss the suit brought by the FTC and certain state Attorneys General with respect to five state law claims and denied the motion with respect to the remaining claims. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

In October 2020, Broadband iTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and 10,536,751, each entitled 'Video-On-Demand Content Delivery System for Providing Video-On-Demand Services to TV Services Subscribers'; 10,028,026, entitled 'System for Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content on TV Services Platform

of a Digital TV Services Provider'; and 9,973,825, entitled 'Dynamic Adjustment of Electronic Program Guide Displays Based on Viewer Preferences for Minimizing Navigation in VOD Program Selection.' The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages. In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $166 million to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the district court granted summary judgment, holding that the patents are invalid. In October 2022, Broadband iTV filed a notice of appeal. In September 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment. This decision is subject to appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

In May 2023, Dialect, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District for Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon's Alexa-enabled products and services, such as Echo devices, Fire tablets, Fire TV sticks, Fire TVs, Alexa, and Alexa Voice Services, infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,693,720 and 9,031,845, each entitled 'Mobile Systems and Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance'; 8,015,006, entitled 'Systems and Methods for Processing Natural Language Speech Utterances with Context-Specific Domain Agents'; 8,140,327, entitled 'System and Method for Filtering and Eliminating Noise from Natural Language Utterances to Improve Speech Recognition and Parsing'; 8,195,468 and 9,495,957, each entitled 'Mobile Systems and Methods of Supporting Natural Language Human-Machine Interactions'; and 9,263,039, entitled 'Systems and Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance.' The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In November 2023, the court granted in part Amazon's motion to dismiss Dialect's complaint and dismissed the '845 patent from the case. In July and August 2024, the court granted in part Amazon's motions for summary judgment, holding that Amazon does not infringe the '327 patent or two claims of the '006 patent and that Dialect cannot recover certain alleged damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

Beginning in October 2023, Nokia Technologies Oy and related entities filed complaints alleging infringement of patents related to video-related technologies against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities in multiple courts in the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil, the Unified Patent Court of the European Union, and the United States International Trade Commission. The complaints allege, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video services and features of Amazon devices carrying the Prime Video app infringe Nokia's patents; some of the complaints additionally allege infringement by Freevee, Twitch, and Amazon voice assistants. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and, in some cases, unspecified money damages, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, and declaratory relief. These matters are at various procedural stages, with preliminary and final injunctions issued in certain instances. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.

The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

(1) The weighted-average remaining lives of the 2014, 2017, 2020, 2021, April 2022, and December 2022 Notes were 10.8, 15.5, 16.8, 14.4, 13.1, and 4.1 years as of September 30, 2024. The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 13.1 years as of September 30, 2024.

Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $60.6 billion and $55.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates.

As of September 30, 2024, we have repaid outstanding borrowings and terminated the secured revolving credit facility with a lender that was secured by certain seller receivables (the 'Credit Facility'). The Credit Facility bore interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and had a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $682 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023, which had an interest rate of 6.6%. As of December 31, 2023, we had pledged $806 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which was based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2023.

In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the 'Term Loan'), maturing in January 2024 and bearing interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. The Term Loan was classified as short-term debt and included within 'Accrued expenses and other' on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the entire amount of the Term Loan had been repaid.

We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the 'Commercial Paper Programs') under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.

We have a $15.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the 'Credit Agreement'), with a term that extends to November 2028 and may be extended for one or more additional one-year terms subject to approval by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, we had a $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the '2023 Short-Term Credit Agreement'). The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the 2023 Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the 2023 Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2023 Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. In October 2024, we replaced the 2023 Short-Term Credit

Agreement with a new $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders on substantially the same terms, which matures in October 2025 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days subject to approval by the lenders.

We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $147 million and $88 million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, which were included in 'Accrued expenses and other' on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $8.4 billion of unused letters of credit as of September 30, 2024.

## Note 6 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

## Stock Repurchase Activity

In March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 or 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program.

## Stock Award Plans

Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years. The majority of restricted stock unit awards are granted at the date of hire or in Q2 as part of the annual compensation review and primarily vest semi-annually in Q2 and Q4 of the relevant compensation year.

## Stock Award Activity

Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.8 billion and 10.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. Stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in millions):

## Note 7 - INCOME TAXES

Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.

Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.

For 2024, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the U.S. federal research and development credit and foreign income deduction and adversely affected by state income taxes. In addition, valuation gains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and may cause variability in our effective tax rate.

Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $4.1 billion, which included $175 million of net discrete tax expense, primarily consisting of discrete tax expense related to shortfalls from stock-based compensation and approximately $600 million of tax benefit resulting from a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our

2022 U.S. federal R&amp;D credit. Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.9 billion, which included $2.4 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion in Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $7.0 billion and $8.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.

As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, income tax contingencies were approximately $5.2 billion and $6.3 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings.

We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods.

We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income.

In September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority ('LTA') denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this matter. We believe the LTA's position is without merit, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect to recoup taxes paid.

The Indian tax authority ('ITA') has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will need to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe the ITA's position is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.

## Note 8 - SEGMENT INFORMATION

We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and infrastructure,' 'Sales and marketing,' and 'General and administrative' based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology costs recorded in 'Technology and infrastructure' are incurred in the U.S. and are included in our North America and AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in 'Technology and infrastructure' are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. Our chief operating decision maker ('CODM') regularly reviews consolidated net sales, consolidated operating expenses, and consolidated operating income (loss) by segment. Amounts included in consolidated operating expenses include 'Cost of sales,' 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and infrastructure,' 'Sales and marketing,' 'General and administrative,' and 'Other operating expense (income), net.' Our CODM manages our business by reviewing annual forecasts and consolidated results by segment on a quarterly basis.

## North America

The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and subscription services through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.

## International

The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and subscription services through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.

## AWS

The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.

## Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

## Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management's expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part II, 'Risk Factors.'

For additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 1 - Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,' of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.

## Inventories

Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $380 million.

In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.

## Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to

## Table of Contents

change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.

Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.

We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $86.8 billion and $88.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $23.5 billion and $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen.

Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $21.2 billion and $26.0 billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $42.5 billion and $70.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(11.8) billion and $(16.9) billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $(37.2) billion and $(56.9) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $11.3 billion and $21.3 billion during Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $34.8 billion and $51.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect cash capital expenditures to meaningfully increase in 2024, primarily driven by investments in technology infrastructure. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $1.6 billion and $622 million during Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $5.5 billion and $4.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. We funded the

## Table of Contents

acquisition of 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In Q3 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a convertible note from Anthropic. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note.

Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(8.9) billion and $(2.8) billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $(9.1) billion and $(8.5) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of $216 million and $1.7 billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $17.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $9.2 billion and $4.5 billion in Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $26.5 billion and $11.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $183 million and $186 million during Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $431 million and $409 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.

We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs as of September 30, 2024. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional information.

Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.

Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $7.0 billion and $8.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.

As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $503 million and $3.6 billion. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies' and 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.

We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.

The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.

## Results of Operations

We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 8 - Segment Information.'

## Overview

Macroeconomic factors, including changes in inflation and interest rates, as well as global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. These may impact customer demand for our products and services and our ability to forecast spending patterns. We expect some or all of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q4 2024.

## Net Sales

Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):

Operating income increased from $11.2 billion in Q3 2023 to $17.4 billion in Q3 2024, and increased from $23.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $47.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.

The increase in North America operating income in Q3 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs.

The International operating income in Q3 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the operating loss in the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact operating income for Q3 2024 or for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The increase in AWS operating income in Q3 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased sales, decreased payroll and related expenses, and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful lives of our servers, partially offset by spending on technology infrastructure that was primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact operating income for Q3 2024, but positively impacted operating income by $183 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

## Cost of Sales

Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.

The increase in cost of sales in Q3 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies, including lower transportation costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $196 million for Q3 2024, and by $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Shipping costs were $21.8 billion and $23.5 billion in Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $62.2 billion and $67.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.

Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as 'Technology and infrastructure' as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.

## Fulfillment

Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing

## Table of Contents

and related transaction costs are included in 'Fulfillment,' AWS costs are primarily classified as 'Technology and infrastructure.' Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.

The increase in fulfillment costs in Q3 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact fulfillment costs for Q3 2024, but reduced fulfillment costs by $127 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.

## Technology and Infrastructure

Technology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.

We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in Q3 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact technology and infrastructure costs for Q3 2024, but reduced technology and infrastructure costs by $166 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We currently expense the majority of the costs associated with the development of our satellite network for global broadband service (including production, launch, and payroll costs, and launch services deposits upon launch). We will capitalize certain of these costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers. See Item 7 of Part II, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview' of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation.

## Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.

Sales and marketing costs in Q3 2024 did not significantly change compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease in sales and marketing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to decreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, partially offset by increased advertising expenses. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact sales and marketing costs for Q3 2024, but reduced sales and marketing costs by $161 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

## Table of Contents

While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.

## General and Administrative

General and administrative costs in Q3 2024 did not significantly change compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease in general and administrative costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses.

## Other Operating Expense (Income), Net

Other operating expense (income), net was $244 million and $262 million for Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $613 million and $587 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, and was primarily related to asset impairments and the amortization of intangible assets.

## Interest Income and Expense

Our interest income was $776 million and $1.3 billion during Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $2.0 billion and $3.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.

Interest expense was $806 million and $603 million during Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $2.5 billion and $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 3 - Leases and Note 5 - Debt' for additional information.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net was $1.0 billion and $(27) million during Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $649 million and $(2.7) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $1.2 billion and $(348) million in Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, and $926 million and $(1.9) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, from our equity investment in Rivian.

## Income Taxes

Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $4.1 billion, which included $175 million of net discrete tax expense. Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.9 billion, which included $2.4 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 7 - Income Taxes' for additional information.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain nonGAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.

We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.

(1) For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, this amount relates to equipment included in 'Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications' of $748 million and $620 million.

(2) For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, this amount relates to property included in 'Principal repayments of finance leases' of $5,245 million and $2,489 million.

All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

## Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates

Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):

## Guidance

We provided guidance on October 31, 2024, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of October 31, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part II, 'Risk Factors.'

## Fourth Quarter 2024 Guidance

- · Net sales are expected to be between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with fourth quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points from foreign exchange rates.
- · Operating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion, compared with $13.2 billion in fourth quarter 2023.
- · This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 2 of Part I, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.'

## Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.

## Foreign Exchange Risk

During Q3 2024, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales in Q3 2024 decreased by $46 million in comparison with Q3 2023.

We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities ('foreign funds'). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of September 30, 2024, of $19.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $975 million, $1.9 billion, and $3.9 billion.

We also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of September 30, 2024, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $570 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to 'Other income (expense), net.'

See Item 2 of Part I, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates' for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.

## Equity Investment Risk

As of September 30, 2024, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and private companies was $12.0 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our equity investment in Rivian, represent $3.9 billion of our investments as of September 30, 2024, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the '1934 Act'), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

During the most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings.'

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 2 of Part I, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,' and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse effect on us.

## Business and Industry Risks

## We Face Intense Competition

Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.

Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.

## Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks

We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.

## Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks

Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.

## Table of Contents

In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:

- · local economic and political conditions;
- · government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain products, technologies, and components); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;
- · restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;
- · business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;
- · limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
- · limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;
- · shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;
- · laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;
- · lower levels of use of the internet;
- · lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;
- · lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;
- · difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;
- · different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;
- · compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;
- · laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and
- · geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.

As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.

The People's Republic of China ('PRC') and India regulate Amazon's and its affiliates' businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.

In addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising revenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade

## Table of Contents

restrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors negatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.

## The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations

Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary fears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.

As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.

## We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers

The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers' descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results.

## We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties

We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.

We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.

We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past,

## Table of Contents

and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and our customers' use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.

Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.

## We Have Foreign Exchange Risk

The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.

## Operating Risks

## Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources

We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.

## We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate

We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.

Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.

Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:

- · our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;
- · our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;
- · our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;
- · the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;
- · changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;
- · timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;
- · the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;
- · the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;
- · the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;
- · variations in the mix of products and services we sell;

## Table of Contents

- · variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;
- · the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;
- · factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics), and public perceptions regarding social or ethical issues related to our development and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, products, and services;
- · the extent to which we invest in technology and infrastructure, fulfillment, and other expense categories;
- · availability of and increases in the prices of transportation (including fuel), resources such as land, water, and energy, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products, including as a result of inflationary pressures;
- · constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;
- · the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;
- · our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;
- · the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings;
- · the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events;
- · the extent to which we fail to maintain our unique culture of innovation, customer obsession, and long-term thinking, which has been critical to our growth and success;
- · disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks, armed hostilities, and political conflicts, including those involving China), labor or trade disputes (including restrictive governmental actions impacting us, our customers, and our third-party sellers and suppliers in China or other foreign countries), and similar events; and
- · potential negative impacts of climate change, including: increased operating costs due to more frequent extreme weather events or climate-related changes, such as rising temperatures and water scarcity; increased investment requirements associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy; decreased demand for our products and services as a result of changes in customer behavior; increased compliance costs due to more extensive and global regulations and third-party requirements; and reputational damage resulting from perceptions of our environmental impact.

## We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers

Failures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.

In addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance products are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.

Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for storage or to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.

## Table of Contents

We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.

## We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches

Because we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors' or customers' technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.

## We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy

We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.

Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.

## The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business

We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have 'key person' life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.

We also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce.

## Table of Contents

We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.

## Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks

We have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, we rely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence infrastructure such as graphics processing units. Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our ability to develop and operate artificial intelligence technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.

## Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks

We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company's sales. Therefore, when the other company's offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.

As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Our present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:

- · disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
- · impairment of other relationships;
- · variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and
- · difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.

## Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments

We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions involve risks such as:

- · disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
- · problems retaining key personnel;
- · additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;
- · the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;

## Table of Contents

- · the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations;
- · the difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing conditions, and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;
- · the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;
- · the difficulty of integrating a new company's accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;
- · losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee's financial performance into our financial results;
- · for investments in which an investee's financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, or investments for which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the dependence on the investee's accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;
- · the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;
- · the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;
- · potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and
- · for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.

As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.

## We Face Significant Inventory Risk

In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product or offering a new service, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.

## We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks

We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer's bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data

## Table of Contents

security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.

## We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile

We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:

- · changes in interest rates;
- · conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;
- · quarterly variations in operating results;
- · fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;
- · changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;
- · changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;
- · changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;
- · changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and
- · transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.

Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.

## Legal and Regulatory Risks

## Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business

We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental and climate-related regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations infringe competition or consumer protection rules, including aspects of Amazon's operation of its stores including its fulfillment network and Prime, Amazon's acquisitions, and certain aspects of AWS's offering of cloud services.

## Table of Contents

We strongly dispute these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these investigations. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data, the interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to uncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. In addition, regulators and lawmakers are increasingly focused on controlling additional aspects of the operations of technology companies and companies they have characterized to be online 'gatekeepers' through the application of existing regulations and laws and the adoption of new regulations and laws, which increases our compliance costs and limits the operation of our business. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks.

## Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations

As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment (including the characterization of delivery drivers), competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties (including artificial intelligence technologies and services), and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.

## We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture

Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for certain product liability claims up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.

## We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations

We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions.

## Table of Contents

Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we operate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.

Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.

Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.

We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals.

## We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations

## 2024 Revolving Credit Agreement

The information set forth below is included for the purpose of providing disclosure under 'Item 1.01 - Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement,' 'Item 1.02 - Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement,' and 'Item 2.03 - Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant' of Form 8-K.

On October 30, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (the 'Company'), Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement (the '2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement'). The 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement replaces the prior $5.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement entered into by the Company, Citibank, N.A., and other lenders on November 1, 2023, which was terminated on October 30, 2024. The 2024 ShortTerm Credit Agreement provides the Company with an unsecured revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $5.0 billion. The term of the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement is 364 days, but it may be extended for an additional period of 364 days subject to approval by the lenders.

The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility.

Borrowings under the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes, including backstopping any notes that the Company may issue under its commercial paper program.

The 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default, but does not contain financial covenants. Upon an event of default that is not cured within the applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the commitments may be terminated.

The financial institutions party to the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage, and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of these financial institutions and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the Company and to persons and entities with relationships with the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.

The foregoing description of the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms of such agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

'Benchmark  Replacement'  means,  for  any  Available  Tenor,  the  alternative  set  forth  in  clause  (1)  below,  or  if  such  alternative  is  not reasonably determinable by the Administrative Agent for the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date, the alternative set forth in clause (2) below:

- (1)    the Daily Simple SOFR; and

Each Loan Notice must be received  by  the Administrative Agent  not  later  than  1:00  p.m.,  New York  City  time,  (i)  three  Business  Days  prior  to  the  requested  date  of  any borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans or of any conversion of Term SOFR Loans denominated to Base Rate Loans, (ii) if applicable pursuant to Section 3.03, one Business Day prior to the requested date of any borrowing of or conversion to Daily Simple SOFR Loans and (iii) on the requested date of any borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be in  an  aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. Each borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans or, if applicable pursuant to Section 3.03, Daily Simple SOFR Loans shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. Each Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a borrowing of Loans, a conversion of Loans from one Type to another or a continuation of Term SOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed, continued or to which existing Loans are to be converted and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. In the case of any conversion or continuation of any Loans, such conversion or continuation shall apply to Loans comprising the same existing Borrowing, it being understood that the Borrower may elect different conversion or continuation options with respect to different portions of the affected existing Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding  the  Loans  comprising  such  Borrowing,  and  the  Loans  comprising  each  such  portion  shall  be  considered  a  separate  Borrowing.  If  the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation of any Term SOFR Borrowing, then, subject to Section 3.03, the applicable Loans shall be made as, or continued as, Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one month. Any such automatic continuation as Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one month shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term SOFR Borrowing. If the Borrower requests a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. No Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency.

(b) Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the details thereof and, in the case of a Loan Notice requesting a borrowing of Loans, of the

principal amount of its Loans to be made as part of the requested borrowing, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation of any Term SOFR Borrowing is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic continuation as Term SOFR Loans as described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a borrowing of Loans, each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent's Account not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, (or, in the case of a Base Rate Loan with respect to which a Loan Notice was delivered after 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of such borrowing, not later than two hours after the delivery of such Loan Notice), on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. The Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case, in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.

- (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, upon the request of the Required Lenders no Loans shall be converted to or continued as Term SOFR Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.
- (d) The Administrative Agent shall, promptly upon request, notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Term SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate.
- (e) After giving effect to all borrowings of Loans, all conversions of Loans from one Type to another, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Term SOFR Borrowings and Daily Simple SOFR Borrowings outstanding at any given time.

## 2.03 Prepayments.

- (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Term SOFR Loans, (B) one Business Day prior to any date of prepayment of Daily Simple SOFR Loans and (C) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans and (ii) any prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in  an  aggregate  amount  that  is  an  integral  multiple  of  the  Borrowing  Multiple  and  not  less  than  the  Borrowing  Minimum  or,  if  less,  the  entire principal amount of such Borrowing then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and, if a Term SOFR Borrowing is to be prepaid, the Interest Period applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice  is  given  by  the  Borrower,  the  Borrower  shall  make  such  prepayment,  and  the  payment  amount  specified  in  such  notice  shall  be  due  and payable, on the date specified in the applicable notice; provided that such notice of prepayment may state that such prepayment is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such prepayment) if any applicable condition is not satisfied. Any prepayment of a Term SOFR Loan or Daily Simple SOFR Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid. Subject to Section 2.13, each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders comprising such Borrowing in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.

- (b) If  the  Administrative  Agent  notifies  the  Borrower  at  any  time  that  the  Total  Outstandings  at  such  time  exceed  the  Aggregate Commitments then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall prepay Loans in an aggregate amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.
- 2.04 Termination or Reduction of Commitments . The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction (or such shorter period  as  may  be  agreed  by  the  Administrative  Agent  in  its  sole  discretion),  (ii)  any  such  partial  reduction  shall  be  (unless  the  Aggregate Commitments are less than such amount) a whole multiple of US$1,000,000 and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments  if,  after  giving  effect  thereto  and  to  any  concurrent  prepayments  hereunder,  the  Total  Outstandings  would  exceed  the Aggregate Commitments. A notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitment may state that such termination or reduction is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such termination or reduction) if any applicable condition is not satisfied. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage. Unless previously terminated, the Aggregate Commitments shall automatically terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Maturity Date. Any reduction or termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall  be  permanent. All unpaid fees accrued pursuant to Section 2.07(a) until the effective date of any reduction or termination of the Aggregate Commitments (in the case of any reduction, in respect of the aggregate amount of the Commitments subject to such reduction) shall be paid on the effective date of such reduction or termination.

2.05 Repayment of Loans. The  Borrower  shall  repay  to  the  Lenders  on  the  Maturity  Date  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  Loans outstanding on the Maturity Date.

| (b) If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then such overdue amount shall thereafter bear interest at a rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. | (b) If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then such overdue amount shall thereafter bear interest at a rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. |

- (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

## 2.07 Fees.

- (a) Commitment  Fee.  The  Borrower  shall  pay  to  the Administrative Agent,  for  the  account  of  each  Lender  in  accordance  with  its Applicable  Percentage,  a  commitment  fee  in  US  Dollars  equal  to  the  Applicable  Rate  times  the  actual  daily  amount  by  which  the  Aggregate Commitments exceed the Total Outstandings, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.13. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and the commitment fee accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, shall be due and payable in arrears on the 15th day following such last day (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the immediately preceding Business Day) and accrued but unpaid commitment fees shall also be due and payable on the last day of the Availability Period.
- (b) Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account, in US Dollars, fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
- 2.08 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by reference to the Prime Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including the first day, but excluding the last day). All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (including the first day, but excluding the last day) (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which such Loan is made, and shall not accrue on any Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which such Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
- 2.09 Evidence of Debt. The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to the Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans to the Borrower in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type, amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

## 2.10 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent's Clawback.

- (a) General. All  payments  to  be  made  by  the  Borrower  shall  be  made  free  and  clear  of  and  without  condition  or  deduction  for  any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, it being understood that nothing in this Section 2.10 shall affect the rights of the Borrower to withhold for Taxes as provided in Section 3.01. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Account in US Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 4:00 p.m., New York City time, shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue until such day. Except as expressly provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
- (b) (i)    Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any borrowing of Loans that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of the applicable Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of  a  payment  to  be  made  by  such  Lender,  the  NYFRB  Rate,  plus  any  administrative,  processing  or  similar  fees  customarily  charged  by  the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the  Loans  comprising  such  Borrowing.  If  the  Borrower  and  such  Lender  shall  pay  such  interest  to  the Administrative Agent  for  the  same  or  an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
- (ii)    Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the NYFRB Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

- (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to the Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
- (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) or 11.05 are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) or 11.05 on any  date  required  hereunder  shall  not  relieve  any  other  Lender  of  its  corresponding  obligation  to  do  so  on  such  date,  and  no  Lender  shall  be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c) or 11.05.
- (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
- 2.11 Sharing  of  Payments  by  Lenders. If  any  Lender  shall,  by  exercising  any  right  of  setoff  or  counterclaim  or  otherwise,  obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that:
- (i) if  any  such  participations  are  purchased  and  all  or  any  portion  of  the  payment  giving  rise  thereto  is  recovered,  such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
- (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as amended from time to time) (including Sections 2.13 and 3.02) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply).

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation  pursuant  to  the  foregoing  arrangements  may  exercise  against  the  Borrower  rights  of  setoff  and  counterclaim  with  respect  to  such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

## 2.12 Extension of Maturity Date.

- (a) Request for Extension. The Borrower may (but only on one occasion during the term of this Agreement), by notice (delivered not fewer than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect (the 'Existing Maturity Date')) to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), request that each Lender agree to extend the Existing Maturity Date for an additional period of 364 days.

- (b) Lender Elections to Extend. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the date that is 20 days after the date of the Borrower's notice requesting an extension of the Maturity Date (the 'Response Date'), advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension; provided that any Lender that does not advise the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Response Date shall be deemed to be have declined to agree to such extension (each Lender agreeing to the requested extension being called an 'Extending Lender', and each Lender declining or deemed to have declined to agree to the requested extension being called a 'Non-Extending Lender'). The election of any Lender to agree or to decline to agree to any requested extension shall be in its sole and individual discretion, and the agreement of any Lender shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.
- (c) Notification by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of each Lender's determination under this Section 2.12 promptly after the Response Date.
- (d) Additional  Commitment  Lenders.  The  Borrower  shall  have  the  right  to  replace  each  Non-Extending  Lender  with  one  or  more Eligible Assignees as provided in Section 11.13.
- (e) Extension  of  Existing  Maturity  Date.  If  Lenders  constituting  not  less  than  the  Required  Lenders  shall  have  agreed,  prior  to  the Existing Maturity Date, to extend the Maturity Date, then, effective as of the Existing Maturity Date, the Maturity Date applicable to the Extending Lenders shall be the date 364 days after the Existing Maturity Date; provided that no extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall become effective unless (the first date on which such consent of the Required Lenders is obtained and the conditions specified in this proviso are satisfied with respect to the applicable requested extension being called the 'Extension Closing Date' with respect thereto), the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate (together with resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or otherwise consenting to such extension) on or prior to the Extension Closing Date signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying that, before and after giving effect to such extension (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality, in which case they shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Extension Closing Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality, in which case they shall be true and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.12, the representations and warranties contained in subsection (a) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements delivered (or otherwise made available) pursuant to  subsection  (a)  of  Section  6.01  (and,  if  any  financial  statements  shall  have  been  subsequently  delivered  pursuant  to  subsection  (b)  of Section 6.01, then also to such financial statements so subsequently delivered), and (B) no Default exists. The Commitment of each Non-Extending Lender shall terminate on the Existing Maturity Date, and the principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by such Non-Extending Lender, together with any accrued interest thereon, and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Non-Extending Lender hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Existing Maturity Date.
- (f) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.11 or 11.01 to the contrary.

## 2.13 Defaulting Lenders.

- (a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:

- (i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender's right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of 'Required Lenders' and Section 11.01.
- (ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;  second,  as  the  Borrower  may  request  (so  long  as  no  Default  exists),  to  the  funding  of  any  Loan  in  respect  of  which  such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender's potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting  Lender  or  as  otherwise  directed  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction;  provided  that  if  (x)  such  payment  is  a  payment  of  the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
- (iii) Certain Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee payable under Section 2.07(a) for any period  during  which  that  Lender  is  a  Defaulting  Lender  (and  the  Borrower  shall  not  be  required  to  pay  any  such  commitment  fee  that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
- (b) Defaulting  Lender  Cure.  If  the  Borrower  and  the Administrative Agent  agree  in  writing  that  a  Lender  is  no  longer  a  Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to commitment fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender and all amendments, waivers or modifications effected without such Lender's consent in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.01 and this Section 2.13 while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender shall be binding on it; and provided further that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender's having been a Defaulting Lender.

## ARTICLE III.

## TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

## 3.01 Taxes.

- (a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation  of  the  Borrower  under  any  Loan  Document  shall  be  made  without  deduction  or  withholding  for  any  Taxes,  except  as  required  by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, then the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.
- (ii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions  as  are  determined  by  the Administrative Agent  to  be  required  based  upon  the  information  and  documentation  it  has  received pursuant  to  subsection  (e)  below,  (B)  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  timely  pay  the  full  amount  withheld  or  deducted  to  the  relevant Governmental Authority  in  accordance  with  the  Code,  and  (C)  to  the  extent  that  the  withholding  or  deduction  is  made  on  account  of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

(iii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions  as  are  determined  by  it  to  be  required  based  upon  the  information  and  documentation  it  has  received  pursuant  to  subsection (e) below, (B) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made  on  account  of  Indemnified  Taxes,  the  sum  payable  by  the  Borrower  shall  be  increased  as  necessary  so  that  after  any  required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

- (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay to the  relevant  Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
- (c) Tax Indemnifications. (i) Without duplication of amounts paid in Section 3.01(a), the Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify each  Recipient,  and  shall  make  payment  in  respect  thereof  within  10  days  after  demand  therefor,  for  the  full  amount  of  any  Indemnified  Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant

Governmental Authority; provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to make payment to any Recipient pursuant to this Section 3.01(c) in respect of penalties, interest and other liabilities attributable to any Indemnified Taxes if (x) written demand therefor has not been made by such Recipient within 60 days from the date on which such Recipient received written notice of the imposition of Indemnified Taxes by the relevant Governmental Authority, but only to the extent such penalties, interest and other similar liabilities are attributable to such failure or delay by the Recipient in making such written demand, (y) such penalties, interest and other liabilities have accrued after the Borrower had indemnified or paid an additional amount due as of the date of such payment pursuant to this Section 3.01 or (z) such penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any of the Recipients or their Affiliates. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender receives a written notice of Tax assessment from any Governmental Authority regarding any Tax in respect of which indemnification may be required pursuant to this Section 3.01(c), the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall notify the Borrower within 120 days following the receipt of such notice that such notice has been received; provided that the  failure  of  the  Administrative  Agent  or  the  Lender  to  provide  such  notice  shall  not  relieve  the  Borrower  of  the  obligation  to  make  any indemnification payment under this Agreement, unless the delay is more than two years from the date of receipt of such notice, in which case the Borrower shall have no obligation to make any indemnification payment under this Agreement. The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) below.

(ii) Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (w) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (x)  the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions  of  Section  11.06(d)  relating  to  the  maintenance  of  a  Participant  Register,  (y)  the Administrative Agent  and  the  Borrower,  as applicable, against any Taxes incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or the Borrower by any Governmental Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered  pursuant  to  subsection  (e)  and  (z)  the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Borrower,  as  applicable,  against  any  Excluded  Taxes attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any  counsel  for  the  Borrower  or  the  Administrative  Agent)  arising  therefrom  or  with  respect  thereto,  whether  or  not  such  Taxes  were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered  to  any  Lender  by  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  be  conclusive  absent  manifest  error.  Each  Lender  hereby  authorizes  the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).

(d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as

the case may be (it being understood that any failure of the Administrative Agent to so notify shall not relieve the Borrower of its indemnification obligations hereunder).

- (e) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. (i) Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times  prescribed  by  applicable  Laws  or  when  reasonably  requested  by  the  Borrower  or  the Administrative Agent,  such  properly  completed  and executed  documentation  prescribed  by  applicable  law  or  the  taxing  authorities  of  a  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  such  applicable  law  or  reasonably requested  by  the  Borrower  or  the Administrative Agent  as  will  permit  such  payments  to  be  made  without  withholding  or  at  a  reduced  rate  of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation either (A) set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), 3.01(e)(ii)(B) or 3.01(e)(ii)(D) or (B) required by applicable law other than the Code or the taxing authorities of the jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable law to comply with the requirements for exemption or reduction of withholding tax in that jurisdiction) shall not be required if in the applicable Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
- (ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
- (A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax and the Administrative Agent shall deliver, on or prior to the Closing Date and from time to time upon the reasonable request of the Borrower, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-9; provided that if the Administrative Agent fails to provide such IRS Form W-9 upon request of the Borrower, the Borrower's sole remedy shall be to withhold to the extent required by the applicable United States Treasury Regulations and, in such case, any such withheld Taxes shall be Excluded Taxes;
- (B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent  (in  such  number  of  copies  as  shall  be  requested  by  the  recipient)  on  or  prior  to  the  date  on  which  such  Foreign  Lender becomes  a  Lender  under  this Agreement  (and  from  time  to  time  thereafter  upon  the  reasonable  request  of  the  Borrower  or  the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
- (1)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the 'interest' article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the 'business profits' or 'other income' article of such tax treaty;

- (2)    executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
- (3)        in  the  case  of  a  Foreign  Lender  claiming  the  benefits  of  the  exemption  for  portfolio  interest  under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a 'bank' within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a '10 percent shareholder' of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a 'controlled foreign corporation' described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a 'U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate') and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or
- (4)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by copies of IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2 or Exhibit D-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
- (C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent  (in  such  number  of  copies  as  shall  be  requested  by  the  recipient)  on  or  prior  to  the  date  on  which  such  Foreign  Lender becomes  a  Lender  under  this Agreement  (and  from  time  to  time  thereafter  upon  the  reasonable  request  of  the  Borrower  or  the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by  applicable  law  to  permit  the  Borrower  or  the Administrative Agent  to  determine  the  withholding  or  deduction  required  to  be made; and
- (D)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), 'FATCA' shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
- (iii)    Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

- (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will any Recipient be required to pay any amount to the  Borrower  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  the  payment  of  which  would  place  such  Recipient  in  a  less  favorable  net  after-Tax  position  than  such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed  and  the  indemnification  payments  or  additional  amounts  with  respect  to  such  Tax  had  never  been  paid.  This  subsection  shall  not  be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
- (g) Contesting Indemnified Taxes. If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Indemnified Taxes for which additional amounts have been paid or are due under this Section 3.01, the Administrative Agent or Lender (as applicable) shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such Indemnified Taxes, at the Borrower's expense, if so requested by the Borrower in  writing;  provided  that  nothing  in  this  Section  3.01(g)  shall  obligate  the  Administrative  Agent  or  any  Lender  to  take  any  action  that,  in  its reasonable judgment, would be materially disadvantageous to such Person.
- (h) Survival. Each party's obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
- (i) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section, the term 'applicable law' includes FATCA.
- 3.02 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to a Relevant Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon a Relevant Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans, as applicable, or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the  interest  rate  on  such  Base  Rate  Loans  of  such  Lender  shall,  if  necessary  to  avoid  such  illegality,  be  determined  by  the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case, until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay all Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans, as applicable, of such Lender or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such

illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans and in the case of Daily Simple SOFR Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

## 3.03 Alternate Rate of Interest. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.03(b), if:

- (i) the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Term SOFR (including because the Term SOFR Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis) for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Daily Simple SOFR; or
- (ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that such Lenders have reasonably determined (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Borrowing, that the Term SOFR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing or (B) at any time, that the Daily Simple SOFR will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Daily Simple SOFR Loans;

then the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Upon receipt of such notice and until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice with respect to the relevant Benchmark, (A) any Loan Notice that requests the making of, conversion to, or continuation of an affected Term SOFR Borrowing shall be ineffective, (B) any request for the making of, conversion to or continuation of an affected Term SOFR Borrowing shall instead be deemed to be a request for the making of, or conversion to, as applicable, (x) a Daily Simple SOFR Borrowing so long as the Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of clause (i) or (ii) above or (y) a Base Rate Borrowing if the Daily Simple SOFR is also the subject of clause (i) or (ii) above, and (C) if any affected Term SOFR Loan is outstanding on the day of the Borrower's receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent with respect to the Term SOFR applicable to such Term SOFR Loan, then such affected Term SOFR Loans shall automatically, on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, unless prepaid, convert to, and shall constitute, (x) a Daily Simple SOFR Borrowing so long as the Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of clause (i) or (ii) above or (y) a Base Rate Borrowing if the Daily Simple SOFR is also the subject of clause (i) or (ii) above.

- (b) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark  Replacement  is  determined  in  accordance  with  clause  (1)  of  the  definition  of  'Benchmark  Replacement'  for  such  Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of 'Benchmark Replacement' for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders and the Borrower without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative

Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.

- (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make, with the consent of the Borrower, Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
- (iii) The  Administrative  Agent  will  promptly  notify  the  Borrower  and  the  Lenders  of  (A)  any  occurrence  of  a  Benchmark Transition Event, (B) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (C) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (D) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (b)(iv) below and (E) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or the Lenders pursuant to this Section 3.03(b), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.03(b).
- (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR) and either (x) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by  the  Administrative  Agent  in  its  reasonable  discretion  or  (y)  the  regulatory  supervisor  for  the  administrator  of  such  Benchmark  has provided  a  public  statement  or  publication  of  information  announcing  that  any  tenor  for  such  Benchmark  is  or  will  be  no  longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of 'Interest Period' for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to  remove  such  unavailable  or  non-representative  tenor  and  (B)  if  a  tenor  that  was  removed  pursuant  to  clause  (A)  above  either  (x)  is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (y) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of 'Interest Period' for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
- (v) Upon the  Borrower's  receipt  of  notice  of  the  commencement  of  a  Benchmark  Unavailability  Period,  the  Borrower  may revoke any request for the borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of any Term SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any  Benchmark  Unavailability  Period  and,  failing  that,  the  Borrower  will  be  deemed  to  have  converted  any  request  for  the  making  of, conversion to or continuation of any Term SOFR Borrowing into a request for the making of, or conversion to, as applicable, (x) a Daily Simple  SOFR  Borrowing  so  long  as  the  Daily  Simple  SOFR  is  not  the  subject  of  a  Benchmark  Transition  Event  or  (y)  a  Base  Rate Borrowing if the Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event. Furthermore, if any Term SOFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower's receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to the Term SOFR, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement is implemented pursuant to this Section 3.03(b), such Term SOFR Loans shall on the last day of the then current

Interest Period applicable thereto, unless prepaid, convert to, and shall constitute, (x) a Daily Simple SOFR Borrowing so long as the Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) a Base Rate Borrowing if the Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event.

## 3.04 Increased Costs.

- (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:
- (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender; or
- (ii) impose on any Lender or the relevant interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. This Section 3.04 shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Section 3.01.

- (b) Capital  and  Liquidity  Requirements.  If  any  Lender  reasonably  determines  that  any  Change  in  Law  affecting  such  Lender  or  any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
- (c) Certificates  for  Reimbursement. A  certificate  of  a  Lender  setting  forth  in  reasonable  detail  the  amount  or  amounts  necessary  to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to the Borrower  shall  be  conclusive  absent  manifest  error.  Such  Lender  shall  also  certify  that  it  is  generally  charging  such  costs  to  similarly  situated customers of the applicable Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 3.04 after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant (which determination shall be made in good faith). The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.
- (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions

is retroactive, then the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

- 3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss (other than lost profit), cost or expense incurred by it (other than by reason of such Lender being a Defaulting Lender) as a result of:
- (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Term SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
- (b) any failure  by  the  Borrower  (for  a  reason  other  than  the  failure  of  such  Lender  to  make  a  Loan)  to  prepay,  borrow,  continue  or convert any Term SOFR Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
- (c) any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.13;

including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Term SOFR Loan made by it at the Term SOFR for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the relevant interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Term SOFR Loan was in fact so funded.

## 3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

- (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. Each Lender may make any Loan through any Lending Office; provided that the exercise of  this  option  shall  not  affect  the  obligation  of  the  Borrower  to  repay  the  Loans  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this Agreement. If  any  Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
- (b) Replacement  of  Lenders.  If  any  Lender  requests  compensation  under  Section  3.04,  or  if  the  Borrower  is  required  to  pay  any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Lending Office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.13.

- 3.07 Survival. All obligations of the Borrower under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

## ARTICLE IX.

## ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

- 9.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank, N.A. to act as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article (other than the Borrower's consent rights in Section 9.06) are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and, except for such consent rights, the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term 'agent' herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
- 9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term 'Lender' or 'Lenders' shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
- 9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:

- (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
- (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be expressly provided for, herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
- (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.02 and 11.01) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, with  such  absence  to  be  presumed  unless  otherwise  determined  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  by  final  and  nonappealable  judgment.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice (stating that it is a 'notice of default') describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.

The  Administrative  Agent  shall  not  be  responsible  for  or  have  any  duty  to  ascertain  or  inquire  into  (i)  any  statement,  warranty  or representation  made  in  or  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  or  any  other  Loan  Document,  (ii)  the  contents  of  any  certificate,  report  or  other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness  or  genuineness  of  this Agreement,  any  other  Loan  Document  or  any  other  agreement,  instrument  or  document  (including,  for  the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the Administrative Agent's reliance on any Electronic Signature transmitted by emailed pdf. or any other electronic  means  that  reproduces  an  image  of  an  actual  executed  signature  page),  (v)  the  satisfaction  of  any  condition  set  forth  in Article  IV  or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items (which on their face purport to be such items) expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or (vi) any determination that any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or the effective date of such status. The motivations of the Administrative Agent are commercial in nature and not to invest in the general performance or operations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may

presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender  prior  to  the  making  of  such  Loan.  The Administrative Agent  may  consult  with  legal  counsel  (who  may  be  counsel  for  the  Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

- 9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such subagent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.

## 9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent.

- (a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the written consent of the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States, and which shall be a U.S. Person. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the 'Resignation Effective Date'), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders, appoint, with the written consent of the Borrower,  a  successor  Administrative  Agent  meeting  the  qualifications  set  forth  above.  Whether  or  not  a  successor  has  been  appointed,  such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.
- (b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the written consent of the Borrower, appoint a successor, which successor shall be a U.S. Person. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the 'Removal Effective Date'), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.
- (c) With  effect  from  the  Resignation  Effective  Date  or  the  Removal  Effective  Date,  as  applicable,  (i)  the  retiring  or  removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) except for any expense  reimbursement  or  indemnity  payments  or  other  amounts  then  owed  to  the  retiring  or  removed  Administrative  Agent,  all  payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor's  appointment  as Administrative Agent  hereunder,  such  successor  shall  succeed  to  and  become  vested  with  all  of  the  rights,  powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to expense reimbursement or indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative

Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the NYFRB Rate.

- (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 11.04.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

Without limiting the provisions of Section 3.01(c), this Section 11.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes, other than any Taxes that represent Liabilities or related expenses arising from any non-Tax claim.

- (ii)    Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned.
- (iii)    Required Consents. Consent shall be required for any assignment to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section 11.06 and in addition:
- (A)    the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event  of  Default  of  the  type  referred  to  in  clause  (a)  or  (f)  of  Section  8.01  has  occurred  and  is  continuing  at  the  time  of  such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof; and
- (B)    the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender.

- (iv)        Assignment  and  Assumption.  The  parties  to  each  assignment  shall  execute  and  deliver  to  the  Administrative  Agent  an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of US$3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
- (v)    No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person that, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person).
- (vi)    Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon)  and  (y)  acquire  (and  fund  as  appropriate)  its  full  pro  rata  share  of  all  Loans  in  accordance  with  its  Applicable  Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 11.06, from and after the effective date  specified  in  each Assignment  and Assumption,  the  assignee  thereunder  shall  be  a  party  to  this Agreement  and,  to  the  extent  of  the  interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 11.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment); provided that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender's having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 11.06.

- (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal

amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 'Register'). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

- (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations  to  any  Person  (other  than  a  natural  person  (or  a  holding  company,  investment  vehicle  or  trust  for,  or  owned  and  operated  for  the primary benefit of a natural person), a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) (each, a 'Participant') in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 11.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.01 that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 11.06 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 11.13 as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section 11.06 and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from which it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive. Each Lender that sells  a  participation  agrees,  at  the  Borrower's  request  and  expense,  to  use  reasonable  efforts  to  cooperate  with  the  Borrower  to  effectuate  the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting as a non-fiduciary agent, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the 'Participant Register'); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or  any  portion  of  the  Participant  Register  (including  the  identity  of  any  Participant  or  any  information  relating  to  a  Participant's  interest  in  any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to  the  contrary.  For  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  the Administrative Agent  (in  its  capacity  as Administrative Agent)  shall  have  no  responsibility  for maintaining a Participant Register.

- (e) Certain  Pledges. Any  Lender  may  at  any  time  pledge  or  assign  a  security  interest  in  all  or  any  portion  of  its  rights  under  this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;

provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

11.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality . Subject to the last sentence of this Section 11.07, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to those of its Affiliates and its and their Related Parties that the Administrative Agent or any such Lender reasonably determines needs to know such Information (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.07), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority that has or claims to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or  proceeding  relating  to  this  Agreement  or  any  other  Loan  Document  or  the  enforcement  of  rights  hereunder  or  thereunder,  (f)  subject  to  an agreement containing provisions substantively the same as (or more restrictive than) those of this Section 11.07, to any assignee of or any prospective assignee  of,  any  of  its  rights  and  obligations  under  this Agreement,  (g)  with  the  consent  of  the  Borrower  or  (h)  to  the  extent  such  Information becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.07. For purposes of this Section 11.07, 'Information' means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (x) nothing contained in this Section 11.07 shall supersede, as to any Information  provided  pursuant  thereto,  any  nondisclosure  or  confidentiality  provision  contained  in  any  nondisclosure  agreement,  confidentiality agreement or other similar agreement (any such agreement, a 'Nondisclosure Agreement') entered into between the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Lender or any of its Affiliates, on the other, to the extent otherwise applicable to any Information; it being understood and agreed that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 11.07 and the nondisclosure or confidentiality provisions contained in any Nondisclosure Agreement as it relates to any such Information, the nondisclosure or confidentiality provision contained in such Nondisclosure Agreement shall govern; and (y) whether or not any Loan Document constitutes Information, the Loan Documents (other than the Fee Letter) can be shared on a confidential basis with (i) any Participant or prospective Participant hereunder, (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (iii) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facility provided hereunder, (iv) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facility provided hereunder or (v) in the case of this Agreement, any market data collector or service provider.

11.08 Right  of  Setoff. If  an  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and  be  continuing,  each  Lender  and  each  of  its Affiliates  is  hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency, but excluding deposits in (i) trust or other fiduciary accounts (to the extent of amounts held therein in trust in the ordinary course of business on behalf of third parties that are not the Borrower or its Subsidiaries), (ii) payroll accounts, (iii) health-savings accounts and worker's compensation accounts, (iv) withholding tax accounts and (v) zero balance accounts used in the ordinary course of business) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not

such obligations of the Borrower are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit  or  obligated  on  such  indebtedness;  provided  that  in  the  event  that  any  Defaulting  Lender  shall  exercise  any  such  right  of  setoff,  (x)  all amounts  so  set  off  shall  be  paid  over  immediately  to  the  Administrative  Agent  for  further  application  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Section 2.13 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of  the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Lenders,  and  (y)  the  Defaulting  Lender  shall  provide  promptly  to  the  Administrative  Agent  a  statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section 11.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or Affiliates  may  have.  Each  Lender  agrees  to  notify  the  Borrower  and  the  Administrative Agent  promptly  after  any  such  setoff  and  application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

11.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the 'Maximum Rate'). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the  principal  of  the  Loans  or,  if  it  exceeds  such  unpaid  principal,  refunded  to  the  Borrower.  In  determining  whether  the  interest  contracted  for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

11.10 Counterparts; Entire Agreement; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in  different  counterparts),  each  of  which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire  contract  among  the  parties  relating  to  the  subject  matter  hereof  (OTHER  THAN  ANY  NONDISCLOSURE  OR  CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS  CONTAINED  IN ANY  NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT  TO  THE  EXTENT APPLICABLE  TO  THE  INFORMATION  (AS DEFINED HEREIN)) and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof (but do not  supersede  any  provisions  of  any  engagement  letter  or  any  fee  letter  that  by  the  terms  of  such  documents  survive  the  effectiveness  of  this Agreement, all of which provisions shall remain in full force and effect). There are no unwritten oral agreements among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including without limitation, Assignment and Assumptions, amendments or other modifications, Loan Notices, waivers and consents) (each, an 'Ancillary Document') that is an Electronic Signature transmitted by emailed .pdf or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

11.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties . All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such

representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

- 11.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
- 11.13 Replacement of Lenders. If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, a Non-Extending Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such  Lender  and  the Administrative Agent,  require  such  Lender  to  assign  and  delegate,  without  recourse  (in  accordance  with  and  subject  to  the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections  3.01  and  3.04)  and  obligations  under  this Agreement  and  the  related  Loan  Documents  to  an  Eligible Assignee  that  shall  assume  such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
- (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 11.06(b)(iv);
- (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
- (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
- (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and
- (e) in  the  case  of  an  assignment  resulting  from  a  Lender  becoming  a  Non-Consenting  Lender,  the  applicable  assignee  shall  have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
- A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
