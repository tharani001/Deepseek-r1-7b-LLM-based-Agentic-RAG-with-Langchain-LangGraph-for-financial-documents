## CFO Outlook Commentary

We expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.

We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.

We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40  billion.  We  continue  to  expect  significant  capital  expenditures  growth  in  2025.  Given  this,  along  with  the  back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.

Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.

In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.

## Forward-Looking Statements

This  press  release  contains  forward-looking  statements  regarding  our  future  business  plans  and  expectations.  These  forwardlooking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to  retain  or  increase  users  and  engagement  levels;  our  reliance  on  advertising  revenue;  our  dependency  on  data  signals  and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth  and  engagement  and  the  user  experience  over  short-term  financial  results;  maintaining  and  enhancing  our  brand  and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries;  litigation  and  government  inquiries;  privacy,  legislative,  and  regulatory  concerns  or  developments;  risks  associated with  acquisitions;  security  breaches;  our  ability  to  manage  our  scale  and  geographically-dispersed  operations;  and  market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 1, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter  ended  September  30,  2024.  In  addition,  please  note  that  the  date  of  this  press  release  is  October  30,  2024,  and  any forward-looking  statements  contained  herein  are  based  on  assumptions  that  we  believe  to  be  reasonable  as  of  this  date.  We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.

For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  United  States  (GAAP),  we  use  the  following  non-GAAP  financial  measures:  revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use  of  non-GAAP  financial  measures  as  an  analytical  tool.  In  addition,  these  measures  may  be  different  from  non-GAAP financial  measures  used  by  other  companies,  limiting  their  usefulness  for  comparison  purposes.  We  compensate  for  these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.

We believe  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  provide  investors  with  useful  supplemental  information  about  the  financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.

Our non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:

Foreign exchange effect on revenue . We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 using the prior  year's  monthly  exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.

Purchases  of  property  and  equipment;  Principal  payments  on  finance  leases. We  subtract  both  purchases  of  property  and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these  two  items  collectively  represent  the  amount  of  property  and  equipment  we  need  to  procure  to  support  our  business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful  supplemental  information  to  help  investors  better  understand  underlying  trends  in  our  business.  Free  cash  flow  is  not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.

For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results" table in this press release.
