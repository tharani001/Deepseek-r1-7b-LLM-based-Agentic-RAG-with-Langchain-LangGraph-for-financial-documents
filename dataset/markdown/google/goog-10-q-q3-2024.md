## Note About Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding:

- · the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success and trends in our business;
- · fluctuations in our revenues and margins and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
- · our expectation that the continuing shift from an offline to online world will continue to benefit our business;
- · our expectation that the portion of our revenues that we derive beyond advertising will continue to increase and may affect our margins;
- · our  expectation  that  our  traffic  acquisition  costs  (TAC)  and  the  associated  TAC  rate  will  fluctuate,  which could affect our overall margins;
- · our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins;
- · fluctuations in paid clicks and cost-per-click as well as impressions and cost-per-impression, and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
- · our  expectation  that  we  will  continue  to  periodically  review,  refine,  and  update  our  methodologies  for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and impressions;
- · our  expectation  that  our  results  will  be  affected  by  our  performance  in  international  markets  as  users  in developing economies increasingly come online;
- · our expectation that our foreign exchange risk management program will not fully offset our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
- · the expected variability of gains and losses related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program;
- · the amount and timing of revenue recognition from customer contracts with commitments for performance obligations,  including  our  estimate  of  the  remaining  amount  of  commitments  and  when  we  expect  to recognize revenue;
- · our expectation that our capital expenditures will increase, including the expected increase in our technical infrastructure investment to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services;
- · our plans to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and systems, as well as to continue to invest in acquisitions and strategic investments;
- · our pace of hiring and our plans to provide competitive compensation programs;
- · our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development (R&amp;D) expenses, sales and marketing expenses,  and  general  and  administrative  expenses  may  increase  in  amount  and/or  may  increase  as  a percentage of revenues and may be affected by a number of factors;
- · estimates of our future compensation expenses;
- · our  expectation  that  our  other  income  (expense),  net  (OI&amp;E),  will  fluctuate  in  the  future,  as  it  is  largely driven by market dynamics;
- · our expectation that our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years;
- · seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage  and  advertiser  expenditures,  underlying  business  trends  such  as traditional retail seasonality, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;
- · the sufficiency of our sources of funding;
- · our  potential  exposure  in  connection  with  new  and  pending  investigations,  proceedings,  and  other contingencies, including the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results;
- · our  expectation  that  we  will  continue  to  face  heightened  regulatory  scrutiny,  and  changes  in  regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results;

## Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

## Note 1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

## Nature of Operations

Google  was  incorporated  in  California  in  September  1998  and  re-incorporated  in  the  State  of  Delaware  in August  2003.  In  2015,  we  implemented  a  holding  company  reorganization,  and  as  a  result,  Alphabet  Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.

We  generate  revenues  by  delivering  relevant,  cost-effective  online  advertising;  cloud-based  solutions  that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.

## Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

## Unaudited Interim Financial Information

These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. We have made estimates and assumptions that  affect  the  amounts  reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In  November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07 "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 "Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose standardized categories in the rate reconciliation  in  both  percentage  and  dollar  amounts. ASU  2023-09  will  also require income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. We will adopt ASU 2023-09 for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025.

## Prior Period Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

## Revenue Backlog

As of  September 30, 2024, we had $86.8 billion of remaining performance obligations ('revenue backlog'), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services  that  have  not  yet  been  recognized  as  revenue.  The  estimated  revenue  backlog  and  timing  of  revenue recognition  for  these  commitments  is  largely  driven  by  our  ability  to  deliver  in  accordance  with  relevant  contract terms and when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.

## Deferred Revenues

We  record  deferred  revenues  when  cash  payments  are  received  or  due  in  advance  of  our  performance, including  amounts  which  are  refundable.  Deferred  revenues  primarily  relate  to  Google  Cloud  and  Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $3.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

## Fair Value Measurements

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  fair  value  and  classified  within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets

## Table of Contents

or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.

Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use  quoted  market  prices  to  the  extent  available  or  alternative  pricing  sources  and  models  utilizing  market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&amp;E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

The following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):

## Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that  have  been  remeasured  during  the  period  based  on  observable  transactions  are  classified  within  Level  2  or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction  date  and  other  unobservable  inputs  including  volatility,  expected  time  to  exit,  risk  free  rate,  and  the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.

As of  September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $33.7 billion, of which $13.7 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and were primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.

## Equity Investments

The carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). Gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  See  Note  6  for  further  details  on  OI&amp;E.  Certain  of  our  non-marketable  equity  securities  include  our investments in variable interest entities (VIE) where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for further details on variable interest entities.

(1) Unrealized gain (loss) on non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is comprised of  $599  million  and  $1.9  billion  of  upward  adjustments  and  $783  million  and  $412  million  of  downward  adjustments (including impairments) for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $1.6 billion and $5.0 billion of upward adjustments and $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively.

In the table above, realized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities  at  the  beginning  of  the  period  or  the purchase date, if later.

Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table  (in  millions),  represents  the  total  net  gains  (losses)  recognized  after  the  initial  purchase  date  of  the  equity security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

## Equity Securities Accounted for Under the Equity Method

As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, equity securities accounted for under the equity method had  a  carrying  value  of  approximately  $1.7  billion  and  $2.0  billion,  respectively.  Our  share  of  gains  and  losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&amp;E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on OI&amp;E. Certain of our equity method securities include our investments in VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for further details on VIEs.

## Convertible Notes

As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, we had investments in convertible notes of $921 million and $2.8 billion, respectively, majority of which are convertible notes held for investment. Our convertible notes held for investment are recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed  is  foreign  exchange  risk.  We  use  foreign  currency  contracts  to  reduce  the  risk  that  our  cash  flows, earnings,  and  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries  will  be  adversely  affected  by  foreign  currency  exchange  rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.

We  recognize  derivative  instruments  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  at  fair  value  and  classify  the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.

## Cash Flow Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.

Cash  flow  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  are  deferred  in  AOCI  and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.

As of September 30, 2024, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $433 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.

## Fair Value Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&amp;E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related  hedged  items.  We  exclude  forward  points  from  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  and  recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&amp;E.

## Net Investment Hedges

We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related  to  our  investment  in  foreign  subsidiaries.  Net  investment  hedge  amounts  included  in  the  assessment  of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&amp;E.

## Other Derivatives

We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&amp;E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

We also  use  derivatives  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  to  manage  risks  relating  to  interest  rates, commodity  prices,  and  credit  exposures,  and  to  enhance  investment  returns.  From  time  to  time,  we  enter  into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other derivatives are primarily reflected within the 'other' component of OI&amp;E. See Note 6 for further details.

## Offsetting of Derivatives

We enter into master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements to reduce credit risk. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets.

The  gross  amounts  of  derivative instruments subject to master  netting arrangements  with  various counterparties, and cash and non-cash collateral received and pledged under such agreements were as follows (in millions):

## Note 4.    Variable Interest Entities

## Consolidated VIEs

We  consolidate  VIEs  in  which  we  hold  a  variable  interest  and  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  The  results  of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, liabilities for which creditors only have  recourse  to  the  VIEs  were  $2.5  billion  and  $1.9  billion,  respectively.  We  may  continue  to  fund  ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets.

Waymo,  a  fully  autonomous  driving  technology  company  and  a  consolidated  VIE,  received  $4.8  billion  in funding during the three months ended September 30, 2024, followed by an additional $860 million in October 2024. The majority of the total funding of $5.6 billion was provided by Alphabet. Investments from external parties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.

As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.4 billion, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material  for  any  period  presented  and  is  included  within  the  "other"  component  of  OI&amp;E.  See  Note  6  for  further details on OI&amp;E.

## Unconsolidated VIEs

We  have  investments  in  VIEs  in  which  we  are  not  the  primary  beneficiary.  These  VIEs  include  private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources.

We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of  operations  and  financial  position  of  these  VIEs  are  not  included  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are  included  within  non-marketable  securities  on  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  The  maximum  exposure  of these  unconsolidated  VIEs  is  generally  based  on  the  current  carrying  value  of  the  investments  and  any  future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

## Note 5.    Debt

## Short-Term Debt

We  have  a  debt  financing  program  of  up  to  $10.0  billion  through  the  issuance  of  commercial  paper.  Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.8% as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of September 30, 2024.

Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.

## Long-Term Debt

Total outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):

(1) Future finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.

(2) Total  current  portion  of  long-term  debt  is  included  within  accrued  expenses  and  other  current  liabilities.  See Note  6  for further details.

The notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.

The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $10.3 billion and $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

## Credit Facility

As of September 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, of which $4.0 billion expires in April 2025 and $6.0 billion  expires  in April  2028. The  interest  rates  for  all  credit  facilities  are  determined  based  on  a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024.

(1) The  amounts  related  to  the  European  Commission  (EC)  fines,  including  any  under  appeal,  are  included  in  accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. Amounts include the effects of foreign exchange and interest. In the third quarter of 2024 we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 EC shopping fine. See Note 9 for further details.

## Note 7.    Business Combinations

## character.ai

In  accordance with the accounting requirements under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded $2.7 billion of goodwill and $413 million of intangible assets  resulting  from  a  transaction  with  character.ai  ('Character').  In  August  2024,  we  entered  into  a  license agreement  with  Character  pursuant  to  which  we  obtained  a  non-exclusive  license  to  its  current  large  language model technology. We paid Character $2.7 billion in cash and canceled our convertible instruments. We also hired certain employees of Character. Goodwill was recorded in Google Services and Google Cloud and is deductible for tax purposes.

## Note 8.    Goodwill

## Note 9.    Commitments and Contingencies

## Commitments

We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $9.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.

## Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities,  we  indemnify  certain  parties,  including  advertisers,  Google  Network  partners,  distribution  partners, customers  of  Google  Cloud  offerings,  lessors,  and  service  providers  with  respect  to  certain  matters.  We  have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements  limit  the  time  within  which  an  indemnification  claim  can  be  made  and  the  amount  of  the  claim.  In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.

It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements  due  to  the  unique  facts  and  circumstances  involved  in  each  particular  agreement. Additionally,  the payments  we  have  made  under  such  agreements  have  not  had  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of operations, cash flows, or financial position.  However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future,  future  payments  by  us  could  be  significant  and  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

As  of  September  30,  2024,  we  did  not  have  any  material  indemnification  claims  that  were  probable  or reasonably possible.

## Legal Matters

We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably  estimated.  If  we  determine  that  a  loss  is  reasonably  possible  and  the  loss  or  range  of  loss  can  be estimated,  we  disclose  the  reasonably  possible  loss.  We  evaluate  developments  in  our  legal  matters  that  could affect  the  amount  of  liability  that  has  been  previously  accrued,  and  the  matters  and  related  reasonably  possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.

Certain  outstanding  matters  seek  speculative,  substantial  or  indeterminate  monetary  amounts,  substantial changes  to  our  business  practices  and  products,  or  structural  remedies.  Significant  judgment  is  required  to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal

matters  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  subject  to  significant  uncertainties,  and  could,  either  individually  or  in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.

We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.

## Antitrust Matters

On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us.

- · On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and  ranking  of  shopping  search  results  and  ads  infringed  European  competition  law.  The  EC  decision imposed  a  €2.4  billion  ($2.7  billion  as  of  June  27,  2017)  fine.  We  appealed  the  EC  decision  and implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and upheld the €2.4 billion fine imposed in 2017. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.
- · On  July  18,  2018,  the  EC  announced  its  decision  that  certain  provisions  in  Google's  Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution  practices.  On  September  14,  2022,  the  General  Court  reduced  the  fine  from  €4.3  billion  to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.
- · On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google  had  with  AdSense  for  Search  partners  infringed  European  competition  law.  The  EC  decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the  EC  decision.  We  recognized  a  charge  of  $1.7  billion  for  the  fine  in  the  first  quarter  of  2019.  On September 18, 2024, the European Union's (EU) General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.

In addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.

In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google . The jury found that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision on October 7, 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a motion  to  pause  the  implementation  of  some  of  the  remedies  pending  the  appeal.  The  trial  court  judge  has temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal.

From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their nature we cannot estimate a possible loss include:

- · In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and on August 5, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being  held  to  determine  remedies,  the  range  of  which  vary  widely.  The  DOJ  has  proposed  a  high  level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations,  including  structural  remedies,  and/or  our  distribution  arrangements,  among  other  changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Further, in June 2022, the Australian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (ACCC)  and  the  United  Kingdom's  Competition  and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.

- · On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for  the  Eastern  District  of  Texas,  alleging  that  Google  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws  as  well  as  state deceptive  trade  laws  relating  to  its  advertising  technology,  and  a  trial  is  scheduled  for  March  2025. Additionally,  on  January  24,  2023,  the  DOJ,  along  with  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General,  filed  an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google's digital advertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint. The trial ended on September 27, 2024, and we expect a decision in late 2024 or early 2025. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into  Google's  advertising  technology  business  practices  on  June  22,  2021,  May  25,  2022,  and  June  29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary  view  that  Google  violated  European  antitrust  laws  relating  to  its  advertising  technology.  We responded  to  the  SO  on  December  1,  2023.  On  September  6,  2024,  the  CMA  issued  an  SO  informing Google  of  its  preliminary  view  that  Google  violated  UK  competition  laws  relating  to  its  advertising technology. We will respond to the SO.
- · In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play's business practices. The EC closed its initial investigation, but is now investigating Google Play's compliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.

We believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.

## Privacy Matters

We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.

## Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain  of  our  products,  services,  and  technologies  infringe  others'  intellectual  property  rights. Adverse  results  in these  lawsuits  may  include  awards  of  substantial  monetary  damages,  costly  royalty  or  licensing  agreements,  or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market,  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  us,  including  preventing  us  from  importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.

Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain  intellectual  property  infringement  claims,  which  would  increase  our  costs  as  a  result  of  defending  such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition,  our  customers  and  partners  may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.

## Other

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our  platforms,  personal  injury,  consumer  protection,  and  other  matters.  For  example,  we  periodically  have  data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and  government  investigations,  and  other  proceedings  could  result  in  substantial  fines  and  penalties,  injunctive relief,  ongoing  monitoring  and  auditing  obligations,  changes  to  our  products  and  services,  alterations  to  our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We have ongoing legal  matters  relating  to  Russia.  For  example,  civil  judgments  that  include  compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

## Non-Income Taxes

We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue  non-income  taxes  that  may  result  from  examinations  by,  or  any  negotiated  agreements  with,  these  tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.

See Note 13 for information regarding income tax contingencies.

## Note 10.    Stockholders' Equity

## Share Repurchases

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased $15.3 billion and $47.0 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.

In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases made pursuant to the April 2023 authorization were completed during the third quarter of 2024. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2024, $59.7 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

(1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of September 30, 2024.

Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment  opportunities,  through  open  market  purchases  or  privately  negotiated  transactions,  including  through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

## Dividends

During  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2024,  total  cash  dividends  were  $1.2  billion  and $2.3  billion  for  Class A,  $173  million  and  $346  million  for  Class  B,  and  $1.1  billion  and  $2.2  billion  for  Class  C shares, respectively.

The  company  intends  to  pay  quarterly  cash  dividends  in  the  future,  subject  to  review  and  approval  by  the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

(1) Not applicable for consolidated net income per share.

For  the  periods  presented  above,  the  holders  of  each  class  are  entitled  to  equal  per  share  dividends  or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc. Holders of Alphabet unvested stock units are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares.

Immaterial differences in net income per share across our Class A, Class B, and Class C shares may arise due to the allocation of distributed earnings based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the allocation of undistributed earnings and number of shares based on weighted average over the periods.

## Note 12.    Compensation Plans

## Stock-Based Compensation

For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, total stock based compensation (SBC) expense was $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $5.6  billion  and  $5.7  billion,  respectively.  For  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2023  and  2024,  total  SBC expense  was  $16.5  billion  and  $17.0  billion,  including  amounts  associated  with  awards  we  expect  to  settle  in Alphabet stock of $16.3 billion and $16.4 billion, respectively.

## Stock-Based Award Activities

The  following  table  summarizes  the  activities  for  unvested  Alphabet  restricted  stock  units  (RSUs),  which include dividend equivalents awarded to holders of unvested stock, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions, except per share amounts):

|                                   | Number of Shares   | Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Unvested as of December 31, 2023  | 338                | $ 104.93                                  |
| Granted                           | 185                | $ 138.23                                  |
| Vested                            | (150)              | $ 110.04                                  |
| Forfeited/canceled                | (29)               | $ 112.01                                  |
| Unvested as of September 30, 2024 | 344                | $ 119.95                                  |

As of September 30, 2024, there was $39.6 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.

## Note 13.    Income Taxes

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):

|                                          | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|                                          | 2023                               | 2024                               | 2023                              | 2024                              |
| Income before provision for income taxes | $ 21,197                           | $ 31,706                           | $ 61,305                          | $ 87,572                          |
| Provision for income taxes               | $ 1,508                            | $ 5,405                            | $ 8,197                           | $ 13,990                          |
| Effective tax rate                       | 7.1 %                              | 17.0 %                             | 13.4 %                            | 16.0 %                            |

We  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  Significant  judgment  is  required  in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $9.4 billion and $12.0 billion, of which $7.4 billion and $9.5 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively.

## Note 14.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:

- · Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received  for  consumer  subscription-based  products  such  as YouTube TV, YouTube  Music  and  Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.
- · Google  Cloud  includes  infrastructure  and  platform  services,  collaboration  tools,  and  other  services  for enterprise  customers.  Google  Cloud  generates  revenues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and subscriptions  received  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  services,  Google  Workspace  communication  and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.
- · Other Bets is  a  combination  of  multiple  operating  segments  that  are  not  individually  material.  Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

Revenues,  certain  costs,  such  as  costs  associated  with  content  and  traffic  acquisition,  certain  engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are

managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.

As  announced  on April  18,  2024,  we  further  consolidated  teams  that  focus  on  building  AI  models  across Google  Research  and  Google  DeepMind  to  further  accelerate  our  progress  in AI. AI  model  development  teams previously  under  Google  Research  in  our  Google  Services  segment  are  included  as  part  of  Google  DeepMind, reported within Alphabet-level activities, prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024.

Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&amp;D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions  during  2023  and  2024  were  also  not  allocated  to  our  segments. Additionally,  hedging  gains  (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.

Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

The following table presents information about our segments (in millions):

## ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with  "Note  About  Forward-Looking  Statements"  and  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," as updated in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Understanding Alphabet's Financial Results

Alphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Revenues and Monetization Metrics

We  generate  revenues  by  delivering  relevant,  cost-effective  online  advertising;  cloud-based  solutions  that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools;  sales  of  other  products  and  services,  such  as  fees  received  for  subscription-based  products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

In  addition  to  the  long-term  trends  and  their  financial  effect  on  our  business  discussed  in  "Trends  in  Our Business  and  Financial  Effect"  in  Part  II,  Item  7  of  our  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended December 31, 2023, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:

- · changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
- · changes  in  pricing,  such  as  those  resulting  from  changes  in  fee  structures,  discounts,  and  customer incentives;
- · general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;
- · new product and service launches; and
- · seasonality.

Additionally,  fluctuations  in  our  revenues  generated  from  advertising  ("Google  advertising"),  revenues  from other sources ("Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.

## Google Services

Google  Services  revenues  consist  of  Google  advertising  as  well  as  Google  subscriptions,  platforms,  and devices revenues.

## Google Advertising

Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following:

- · Google  Search  &amp;  other,  which  includes  revenues  generated  on  Google  search  properties  (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
- · YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and
- · Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

We use certain  metrics  to  track  how  well  traffic  across  various  properties  is  monetized  as  it  relates  to  our advertising  revenues:  paid  clicks  and  cost-per-click  pertain  to  traffic  on  Google  Search  &amp;  other  properties,  while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.

Paid  clicks  represent  engagement  by  users  and  include  clicks  on  advertisements  by  end-users  on  Google search properties  and  other  Google  owned  and  operated  properties  including  Gmail,  Google  Maps,  and  Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.

Impressions  include  impressions  displayed  to  users  on  Google  Network  properties  participating  primarily  in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

As  our  business  evolves,  we  periodically  review,  refine,  and  update  our  methodologies  for  monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.

Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &amp; other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as:

- · advertiser competition for keywords;
- · changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;
- · changes in device mix;
- · seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and
- · traffic  growth  in  emerging  markets  compared  to  more  mature  markets  and  across  various  verticals  and channels.

## Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices

Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:

- · consumer subscriptions,  which  primarily  include  revenues  from YouTube  services,  such  as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;
- · platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;
- · devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and
- · other products and services.

Fluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected  by  factors  in  addition  to  the  general  factors  described  above,  such  as  changes  in  customer  usage  and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:

- · Google  Cloud  Platform,  which  generates  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  for  infrastructure, platform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud;
- · Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises,  such  as  Calendar,  Gmail,  Docs,  Drive,  and  Meet,  with  integrated  features  like  Gemini  for Google Workspace; and
- · other enterprise services.

Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as customer usage.

## Other Bets

Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

## Costs and Expenses

Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of  our  operating  expenses,  are  generally  less  variable  in  nature  and  may  not  correlate  to  changes  in  revenue. Additionally,  fluctuations  in  compensation  expenses  may  not  directly  correlate  with  changes  in  headcount,  in particular due to annual SBC awards that generally vest over four years.

## Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.

- · TAC includes:
- ◦ amounts  paid  to  our  distribution  partners  who  make  available  our  search  access  points  and services.  Our  distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment manufacturers, and software developers; and
- ◦ amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
- · Other cost of revenues primarily includes:
- ◦ compensation expense related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content review and customer and product support;
- ◦ content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and  other  content  for  distribution  on  YouTube  and  Google  Play  (we  pay  fees  to  these  content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);
- ◦ depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;
- ◦ inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and
- ◦ other technical infrastructure operations costs, including bandwidth, energy, and equipment costs.

TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.

## Operating Expenses

Operating  expenses  are  generally  incurred  during  our  normal  course  of  business,  which  we  categorize  as either R&amp;D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.

The main components of our R&amp;D expenses are:

- · compensation  expenses  for  engineering  and  technical  employees  responsible  for  R&amp;D  related  to  our existing and new products and services;
- · depreciation; and
- · third-party  services  fees  primarily  relating  to  consulting  and  outsourced  services  in  support  of  our engineering and product development efforts.

The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:

- · compensation  expenses  for  employees  engaged  in  sales  and  marketing,  sales  support,  and  certain customer service functions; and
- · spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.

The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:

- · compensation  expenses  for  employees  in  finance,  human  resources,  information  technology,  legal,  and other administrative support functions;
- · expenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and
- · third-party  services  fees,  including  audit,  consulting,  outside  legal,  and  other  outsourced  administrative services.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

OI&amp;E,  net  primarily  consists  of  interest  income  (expense),  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.

For additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk' in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Provision for Income Taxes

Provision  for  income  taxes  represents  the  estimated  amount  of  federal,  state,  and  foreign  income  taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

## Google Services

## Google advertising revenues

## Google Search &amp; other

Google Search &amp; other revenues increased $5.4 billion and $17.0 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.

## YouTube ads

YouTube  ads  revenues  increased  $969  million  and  $3.4  billion  from  the  three  and  nine  months  ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The growth was driven by our brand advertising products followed by our direct response advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers.

## Google Network

Google Network revenues decreased $121 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in AdSense revenues.

Google Network revenues decreased $610 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in AdMob revenues.

## Monetization Metrics

The following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search &amp; other revenues (paid clicks and  cost-per-click) and  Google  Network  revenues  (impressions  and  cost-per-impression),  expressed  as  a percentage, from three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to three and nine months ended September 30, 2024:

|                            | Three Months Ended September 30, 2024   | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|

| Paid clicks change         | 4 %                                     | 5 %                                    |
| Cost-per-click change      | 8 %                                     | 8 %                                    |
| Google Network             |                                         |                                        |
| Impressions change         | (14)%                                   | (15)%                                  |
| Cost-per-impression change | 15 %                                    | 14 %                                   |

Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.

Changes  in  cost-per-click  and  cost-per-impression  are  driven  by  a  number  of  interrelated  factors  including changes in  device  mix,  geographic  mix,  advertiser  spending,  ongoing  product  and  policy  changes,  product  mix, property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

## Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices

Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $2.3 billion and $4.8 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The growth was primarily driven by increases in subscriptions and devices revenues. The increase in subscriptions revenues was largely from growth in the number of paid subscribers for YouTube services and to a lesser extent for Google One. The increase in devices revenues was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices, due to Pixel family product launch timing in the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year.

## Google Cloud

Google  Cloud  revenues  increased  $2.9  billion  and  $7.4  billion  from  the  three  and  nine  months  ended September  30,  2023  to  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2024,  respectively.  The  growth  was primarily driven by Google Cloud Platform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.

## Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information

International  revenues,  which  represent  a  significant  portion  of  our  revenues,  are  generally  transacted  in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons.  We  use  non-GAAP  constant  currency  revenues  ("constant  currency  revenues")  and  non-GAAP percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues  ("percentage  change  in  constant  currency  revenues")  for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.

Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period  over  period.  We  define  constant  currency  revenues  as  revenues  excluding  the  effect  of  foreign  currency exchange rate  movements  ("FX  Effect")  as  well  as  hedging  activities,  which  are  recognized  at  the  consolidated level.  We  use  constant  currency  revenues  to  determine  the  constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  on  a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.

Constant  currency  revenue  percentage  change  is  calculated  by  determining  the  change  in  current  period revenues  over  prior  year  comparable  period  revenues  where  current  period  foreign  currency  revenues  are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.

These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.  Results  on  a  constant  currency  basis,  as  we  present  them,  may  not  be  comparable  to  similarly  titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

The following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in millions, except percentages):

(1) Total constant currency revenues of $256.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $35.0 billion compared to $221.1 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

EMEA revenue growth was not materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as the effect of the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira was largely offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the British pound.

APAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.

Other Americas  revenue  growth  was  unfavorably  affected  by  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.

| Other cost of revenues                             | 20,587                             | 22,755                             | 58,857                            | 65,641                            |
| Total cost of revenues                             | $ 33,229                           | $ 36,474                           | $ 95,757                          | $ 105,693                         |
| Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues | 43 %                               | 41 %                               | 43 %                              | 42 %                              |

Cost of revenues increased $3.2 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $2.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Cost of revenues increased $9.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $6.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.

The increase in TAC from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.2% to 20.8% from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased from 21.4% to 20.8% from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search &amp; other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search &amp; other revenues increased from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended  September  30,  2024  primarily  due  to  increases  related  to  mobile  searches,  which  carries  higher  TAC because  more  mobile  searches  are  channeled  through  paid  access  points.  The  TAC  rate  on  Google  Network revenues was substantially consistent from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended  September  30,  2024  was  primarily  due  to  increases  in  content  acquisition  costs,  largely  for  YouTube, depreciation expense, and devices costs, due to Pixel family product launch timing in the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year.

The increase in other cost of revenues from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended  September  30,  2024  was  primarily  due  to  increases  in  content  acquisition  costs,  largely  for  YouTube, depreciation  expense,  other  technical  infrastructure  operations  costs,  and  third-party  service  fees.  Additionally, devices costs contributed to the increase in other cost of revenues due to the Pixel family product launch timing in the third quarter this year as compared to the fourth quarter last year.

revenues

R&amp;D expenses increased $1.2 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses of $358 million, depreciation expense of $353 million, and charges related to our office space optimization efforts of $188 million. The increase in compensation expenses was largely due to an increase in SBC expense of $214 million.

R&amp;D expenses increased $2.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by increases in depreciation expense of $993 million, compensation expenses of $879 million, and third-party services fees of $597 million. The increase in compensation expenses was primarily driven by a $1.0 billion increase in SBC expenses, which reflects the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by a $554 million decrease in severance and related charges.

## Sales and Marketing

The following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages):

|                                                          | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   |

The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in TAC and content acquisition  costs.  Additionally,  a  reduction  in  compensation  expenses  contributed  to  the  increase  in  operating income.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud operating income increased $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion from the three and nine months ended September  30,  2023  to  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2024,  respectively.

OI&amp;E increased $3.3 billion  from  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2023  to  the  three  months  ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and market driven changes, and increased net gains on debt securities.

OI&amp;E  increased  $5.4  billion  from  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2023  to  the  nine  months  ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions and increased interest income related to higher interest rates.

## Provision for Income Taxes

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):

|                                          | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Three Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|                                          | 2023                               | 2024                               | 2023                              | 2024                              |
| Income before provision for income taxes | $ 21,197                           | $ 31,706                           | $ 61,305                          | $ 87,572                          |
| Provision for income taxes               | $ 1,508                            | $ 5,405                            | $ 8,197                           | $ 13,990                          |
| Effective tax rate                       | 7.1 %                              | 17.0 %                             | 13.4 %                            | 16.0 %                            |

The effective tax rate increased from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a cumulative one-time adjustment recorded for tax rule changes issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction in 2024 contributed to the higher effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a one-time adjustment for tax rule changes issued by the IRS in the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation-related tax benefits in 2024.

The OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect others to follow, however we do not expect a material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As additional  jurisdictions  enact  such  legislation,  transitional  rules  lapse,  and  other  provisions  of  the  minimum  tax legislation become effective, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.

## Financial Condition

## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities

As  of  September  30,  2024,  we  had  $93.2  billion  in  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term  marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities.

## Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.

The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):

|                                           | Nine Months Ended September 30,   | Nine Months Ended September 30,   |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|                                           | 2023                              | 2024                              |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 82,831                          | $ 86,186                          |
| Net cash used in investing activities     | $ (20,896)                        | $ (29,356)                        |
| Net cash used in financing activities     | $ (52,785)                        | $ (60,697)                        |

## Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search &amp; other properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through  consumer  subscriptions,  the  sale  of  apps  and  in-app  purchases,  and  devices.  In  Google  Cloud,  we generate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools, and other cloud services.

Our  primary  uses  of  cash  from  operating  activities  include  payments  to  distribution  and  Google  Network partners,  to  employees for  compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities

include  payments  to  suppliers  for  devices,  to  tax  authorities  for  income  taxes,  and  other  general  corporate expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in  tax  payments  and  a  cash  payment  for  the  2017  EC  shopping  fine. The  increase  in  tax  payments  in comparison to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California.

## Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets.

Net cash used in investing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months  ended  September  30,  2024  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  purchases  of  property  and  equipment  and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities.

## Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months  ended  September  30,  2024  due  to  dividend  payments  and  net  payments  related  to  stock-based  award activities.

## Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and  financing  activities  to  continue  to  be  sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities  and  cash  commitments  for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

## Capital Expenditures and Leases

We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.

## Capital Expenditures

Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:

- · technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and
- · office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").

Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from  months  to  years.  For  example,  our  data  center  construction  projects  are  generally  multi-year  projects  with multiple  phases,  where  we  acquire  land  and  buildings,  construct  buildings,  and  secure  and  install  information technology assets.

During  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2023  and  2024,  we  spent  $21.2  billion  and  $38.3  billion  on capital  expenditures,  respectively.  We  expect  to  increase,  relative  to  2023,  our  investment  in  our  technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our  long-term  initiatives,  in  particular  in  support  of  AI  products  and  services.  Depreciation  of  our  property  and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment was $8.6 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively.

## Leases

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, we recognized total operating lease assets of $2.4 billion  and $1.6 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.8 years, was $17.1 billion.

As  of  September  30,  2024,  we  have  entered  into  leases  that  have  not  yet  commenced  with  future  lease payments  of  $6.1  billion,  that  are  not  yet  recorded  on  our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  These  leases  will commence between 2024 and 2027 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease  costs)  were  $3.4  billion  and  $3.5  billion,  respectively.  Finance  lease  costs  were  not  material  for  the  nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024.

## Financing

We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we had $1.0 billion of short-term commercial paper outstanding.

As of September 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using  certain  market  rates,  as  well  as  our  progress  toward  the  achievement  of  certain  sustainability  goals.  No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.

As of September 30, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion. For additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of these  arrangements  result  in  a  portion  of  the  cash  received  from  and  paid  to  the  contract  manufacturers  to  be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Share Repurchase Program

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 90 million and 293 million shares for $15.3 billion and $47.0 billion, respectively.

In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases made pursuant to the April 2023 authorization were completed during the third quarter of 2024. In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2024, $59.7 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):

|                             | Three Months Ended September 30, 2024   | Three Months Ended September 30, 2024   | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024   | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|                             | Shares                                  | Amount                                  | Shares                                 | Amount                                 |
| Class A share repurchases   | 17                                      | $ 2,846                                 | 59                                     | $ 9,461                                |
| Class C share repurchases   | 73                                      | 12,453                                  | 234                                    | 37,493                                 |
| Total share repurchases (1) | 90                                      | $ 15,299                                | 293                                    | $ 46,954                               |

(1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of September 30, 2024.

For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Dividend Program

During  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2024,  total  cash  dividends  were  $1.2  billion  and $2.3 billion  for  Class A,  $173  million  and  $346  million  for  Class  B,  and  $1.1  billion  and  $2.2  billion  for    Class  C shares, respectively.

The  company  intends  to  pay  quarterly  cash  dividends  in  the  future,  subject  to  review  and  approval  by  the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

## European Commission Fines

In  2017,  2018,  and  2019,  the  EC  announced  decisions  that  certain  actions  taken  by  Google  infringed European competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively.

On  September  14,  2022,  the  General  Court  reduced  the  2018  fine  from  €4.3  billion  to  €4.1  billion.  We subsequently appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.

On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal of the 2017 decision and upheld the €2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.

On September 18, 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.

We included the EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated  Balance  Sheets,  as  we  provided  bank  guarantees  (in  lieu  of  a  cash  payment)  for  the  fines.  For additional  information,  see  Note  9  of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included  in  Item  1  of  this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## Taxes

As  of  September  30,  2024,  we  had  short-term  income  taxes  payable  of  $2.7  billion,  related  to  a  one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the remaining transition tax installment in 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable of $8.2 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024.

## Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations

As of September 30, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $50.8 billion,  of  which  $31.1  billion  was  short-term.  These  amounts  primarily  consist  of  purchase  orders  for  certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or  pricing  as  of  September  30,  2024.  In  certain  instances,  the  amount  of  our  contractual  obligations  may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy  attributes,  such  as  renewable  energy  certificates.  These  agreements  do  not  include  a  minimum  dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.

## ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Based  on  this  evaluation,  our  chief  executive  officer  and  chief  financial  officer  concluded  that,  as  of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  we  are  required  to  disclose  in  reports  that  we  file  or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in  the  SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

## PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

## ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 9 'Commitments and Contingencies Legal Matters' of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference.

## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,  2023,  as  updated  in  our  subsequent  Quarterly  Reports  on  Form  10-Q,  which  could  harm  our  business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

We are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations,  enforcement  actions,  consent  orders,  and  other  forms  of  regulatory  scrutiny  and  legal liability, including competition matters, that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.

The DOJ, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file in the future, several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store.

For example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google violated antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. The Court is holding a separate proceeding to determine remedies, which could include alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal, there can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of  any  remedies  that  may  be  ordered,  and  any  or  all  of  these  potential  remedies  could  harm  our  business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Also,  in  December  2023,  a  California  jury  delivered  a  verdict  in Epic Games v. Google finding  that  Google violated  antitrust  laws  related  to  Google  Play's  business.  The  presiding  judge  issued  a  remedies  decision  on October  7,  2024  that  ordered  a  variety  of  alterations  to  our  business  models  and  operations  and  contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a motion to pause the implementation of some of the remedies pending the appeal, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal or in our efforts to pause the implementation of the remedies pending the appeal. If we are unsuccessful, we could face  significant  expenses  to  implement  the  remedies,  and  such  costs  and  alterations  could  harm  our  business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Other  regulatory  agencies  in  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world,  including  competition  enforcers,  consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.

We are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation,  negligence,  breaches  of  contract,  patent,  copyright  and  trademark  infringement,  unfair  competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information  available  on  or  via  our  services,  the  design  and  effect  of  our  products  and  services,  or  due  to  our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties.

Various  laws,  regulations,  investigations,  enforcement  lawsuits,  and  regulatory  actions  have  involved  in  the past, and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations,  changes  to  our  products  and  services,  alterations  to  our  business  models  and  operations,  including divestiture,  and  collateral  related  civil  litigation  or  other  adverse  consequences. Any  of  these  legal  proceedings could also result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, and negative publicity, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Estimating  liabilities  for  our  pending  proceedings  is  a  complex,  fact-specific,  and  speculative  process  that requires  significant  judgment,  and  the  amounts  we  are  ultimately  liable  for  may  be  less  than  or  exceed  our estimates.  The  resolution  of  one  or  more  such  proceedings  has  resulted  in,  and  may  in  the  future  result  in, additional  substantial  fines,  penalties,  injunctions,  and  other  sanctions  that  could  harm  our  business,  reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

For additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

## ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

## 10b5-1 Trading Plans

During  the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2024,  the  following  Section  16  director  adopted,  modified,  or terminated a 'Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement' (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act):

- · Frances Arnold, a member of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, adopted a trading plan on July 26, 2024 (with the first trade under the plan scheduled for October 30, 2024). The trading plan will be effective until November 7, 2025 to sell 50% of the (net) shares resulting from the vesting of 3,345 (gross) shares of Class C Capital Stock, in addition to 50% of the (net) shares of any future grants awarded during the term of the plan.

There  were  no  'non-Rule  10b5-1  trading  arrangements'  (as  defined  in  Item  408  of  Regulation  S-K  of  the Exchange Act) adopted, modified or terminated during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 by our directors and Section 16 officers. Each of the Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements are in accordance with our Policy Against Insider Trading  and  actual  sale  transactions  made  pursuant  to  such  trading  arrangements  will  be  disclosed  publicly  in Section 16 filings with the SEC in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations.

## Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On April  16,  2024,  the  Leadership  Development,  Inclusion  and  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of Directors  of  Alphabet  approved  the  accrual  of  dividend  equivalent  units  to  holders  of  all  unvested  stock  units, subject to the approval of a dividend declaration by the Board of Directors of the company (which was announced

on October 29, 2024). As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to participate  in  any  dividends  (including  the  one  referenced  above),  the  crediting  of  dividend  equivalent  units  is intended to preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the company when the stock units were granted and to treat the holders of stock units consistently with all stockholders.

## Required Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act

During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Google LLC, a subsidiary of Alphabet, filed a notification with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) pursuant to Russian encryption control requirements, which must be complied with prior to the import of covered items. Neither we nor our subsidiaries generated any gross revenues or net profits directly from such activity and neither we nor our subsidiaries sell to the FSB. In the ordinary course of its business, Alphabet expects that Google LLC will continue to file these notifications as required under Russian law.
